Pandey, You Need glasses!

3
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,010
Who's that?

4
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,550
Is that you... Dev Sir?

5
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
You're always cropped
under the table..

6
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,800
..how will I see you? One sec...

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,180
Sir, if I may ask..

8
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,390
Why don't you go home early?

9
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,470
Aren't you married?

10
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,760
Marriage is a celebration in countryside.

11
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,550
In Big cities, it is a regret.

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,100
Oh no.

13
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,800
"O crazy heart better brace yourself."

14
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,800
"You must know how
to pleasure yourself."

15
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,890
"Don't think twice and,
just do-do-do it.."

16
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,220
"Just do this sin..!"

17
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,970
"The world's full of disappointment."

18
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,800
"Your happiness is in your Palm.."

19
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:43,220
"Don't wait..and celebrate this joy"

20
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,390
"Just do this sin..!"

21
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,140
"As they say that.."

22
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,010
"..even walls have ears."

23
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,970
"So do it without making a noise."

24
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,890
"You don't need anyone's help.."

25
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,550
"..cause you're a proud man."

26
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,390

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,390
"Don't ever break it..my love."

43
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:22,220
"The bond we share.."

44
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,550
"..don't ever share
it with anyone else."

45
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,470
Did you pay for the
Danadhan Tv subscription?

46
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I'll do it today.

47
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,600
"Julie-Julie-Julie..
You're not ordinary."

48
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
"I can even give
my life for your love.."

49
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,930
"Hey lover-boy,
don't try to flirt with me.

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,640
"Don't try to get in my way..."

51
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,760
Alright, listen up, listen up.
Boss is talking.

52
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,350
Everyone has a roll?

53
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,140
Awesome!

54
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,760
Okay, we've two big
announcements today.

55
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,350
First; We have a new addition
to the 'My Handy' team.

56
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,010
Prabha Ghatpande.

57
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,260
Please give her a
big round of applause.

58
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,350
Never mind.

59
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,760
- Pandey.
- Yes, sir.

60
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,760
Sensation is the new
motto of our company..

61
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,930
She's a virgin.

62
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,180
And what you are holding
is our new toilet paper rolls.

63
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,510
I can tell by just looking at her.

64
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,430
3 times softer,
more absorbent, and colorful.

65
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,260
And now..

66
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,640
Just close your eyes..

67
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,050
..and feel this toilet paper.
Like this.

68
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,300
You felt it!

69
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,930
I saw your eyes open. You felt it.

70
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,720
- Sir..
- You felt it.

71
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,220
- Yes.. tell me..
- Sir, it's the pin..

72
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,680
No, even my eyes opened like this.

73
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,640
When I first felt
it on my cheeks, it was..

74
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,220
Magical.

75
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,760
You know, I always wondered..

76
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,470
..in a country, where we
don't have enough water to drink..

77
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,390
..how do people find water
to clean their backside?

78
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,680
And then I realized..

79
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,300
It's not about the water.

80
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,680
It's about the touch of the hand!

81
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,760
And this toilet paper
comes closest to that touch!

82
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,930
What?
You don't believe me.

83
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,720
Oh you will.

84
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,720
Now, one by one..

85
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,430
..you will rub this on your cheeks.

86
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,930
No, I am not talking
about these cheeks.

87
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,390
I'm telling you, dude.

88
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,430
His father was doing a good job.

89
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,970
Sales were good.

90
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,890
God knows what knowledge this
Jackass has got from America.

91
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,800
Wiping one's butt has become
a psychological research

92
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,010
In fact, given a chance
this guy would..

93
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,390
..pull down people's pants himself,
and..yuck!

94
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,800
He is crazy. Coming?

95
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,220
"Disappear into your
own little world."

96
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,430
"Make yourself scarce like a secret."

97
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:40,050
"Make your plans right now."

98
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,100
Prabha.

99
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,100
What a divine name.

100
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
No one keeps such names anymore.

101
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,760
But if you think,
the name can even arouse you.

102
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,760
Say it.

103
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,800
Prabha!

104
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,930
What's up bro... I've noticed you're
always in a bad mood these days.

105
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,550
Is everything okay at home?

106
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,640
I mean, Pandey told me..

107
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,850
..you stay in the
office till late hours.

108
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,100
Don't mind..and,
I don't mean any disrespect.

109
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,760
Your wife's really gorgeous.

110
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,850
But..you don't value her.

111
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,300
Your Marriage is like a Rock Ballet..

112
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,390
..Don't turn it into a Church Gospel.

113
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Trust me; just give it to her tonight!

114
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,760
Surprise!

115
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,890
Women love surprises.

116
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,680
And don't forget to take flowers.

117
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm speaking from experience.

118
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,970
Got it.

119
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,890
Leaving early, sir?

120
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,220
There is a flower shop
downstairs, right?

121
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,220
- Will it be open?
- I think..

122
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,850
Ohh...it's Wednesday.

123
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,050
Flower market's closed today.

124
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,100
- The entire flower market's closed today?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,640
[Song playing on TV]

126
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,050
- Yeah Baby.
- What are you doing Ranjit.

127
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,260
Surprise..

128
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,760
One day he'll barge in saying that.

129
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,800
And we'll be gasping.

130
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,600
Stop it, Ranjit.

131
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,850
You make everything sound so vulgar.

132
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,600
Dev always texts me
before he leaves for home.

133
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,800
That's true.

134
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,680
By the way..
What does this Dev look like?

135
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,390
Like a husband.

136
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,470
- Dev..
- We didn't do it.

137
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,640
Dev! Dev! Dev! Dev..

138
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,800
- No, no.. Dev..
- We didn't do it.

139
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,890
- No, no.. Dev..Dev, please.
- No! No!

140
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,550
"I gave you.."

141
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,100
"my delicate heart."

142
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:57,430

145
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,390
"..don't ever share
it with anyone else."

146

"Never.."

147
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,140

"..my love."

164
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,390
You're back, Tommy.

165
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,550
Tommy..

166
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,010
Come here. Here Boy.

167
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,680
What's this 'Tommy' nonsense?

168
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,140
So should I straight call you a Dog!

169
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,720
- Dolly, please..
- Tommy wait, stop..

170
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,180
Wait..stop..excuse me.

171
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,550
Where were you dicking around?

172
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,930
Hey..

173
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,390
- Whose rotten food were
you feasting on...Tell me. - Dolly!

174
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,260
Hey, Tommy.

175
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,010
Forget it.

176
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,140
Let me take a look at your neck.

177
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,180
What if someone put a leash on you?

178
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,100
But how can someone
put a leash on you?

179
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,800
After all, you're a mangy cur.

180
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,510
Must be lying in a dumpster!

181
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,300
Dolly!

182
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,260
Don't bark!

183
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,640
Just tell me where you had been.

184
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,470
Otherwise..I'll tell papa..

185
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,430
..to stop giving you the
10,000 rupees every week.

186
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,970
I went to a bar..

187
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,050
..with my friends.

188
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,850
Bar?

189
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,800
Friends?

190
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,180
Vishal, Sumit, and Bhonsle!

191
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,970
My old gym trainers.
We used to work together.

192
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,010
Feel free to ask.

193
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,850
Who paid?

194
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,100
It was Bhonsle's treat.

195
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,100
You're such a freeloader.

196
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,430
You're already sucking us dry..

197
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,930
..at least leave your friends alone.

198
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,010
Friends don't mind.

199
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,510
Then let them pay for
your expenses as well.

200
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,390
And leave me alone.

201
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,350
And stop cutting your
nose hair all the time.

202
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,890
Mister..

203
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,300
Please call Jatin.

204
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,510
- Who?
- Jatin. Jatin.

205
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,680
He just went inside.

206
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,220
There is no Jatin here.

207
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,890
- Isn't this Jatin Gupta's house?
- No.

208
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,800
I see..

209
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
10 secrets ways
to find out someone's name..

210
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,930
Even I have this Whatsapp message.

211
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,430
You want his name?

212
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,720
Do you want his name?

213
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,890
Yes.

214
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,220
100 rupees.

215
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,140
Dolly Verma.

216
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,800
Corporator Digpal Verma's daughter.

217
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,220
And the guy who just went inside?

218
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,930
100 rupees more.

219
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,800
Ranjit Arora..

220
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,800
Dolly Verma's husband!

221
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,850
Did you pay the Dhanadan Tv Bill?

222
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,350
Dev.. I am asking you.
Bill..

223
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,850
So..how was the surprise?

224
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,470
What's wrong?
She didn't like it.

225
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,800
I see.

226
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,100
Which flowers did you take?

227
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,640
Roses?

228
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,260
Damn...

229
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,260
That's where you went wrong.

230
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,850
You should've got orchids instead.

231
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,140
She would've kissed you.

232
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,760
I'm speaking from experience.

233
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,800
Anyway..let me lighten
your mood with a joke.

234
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,800
Don't worry.

235
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,180
After dinner, husband to his brother.

236
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,800
'You know what,
your sister-in-law is really blessed.'

237
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,390
'The food she makes
satisfies my soul!'

238
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,180
Brother to husband,
'why of course, she is truly blessed.'

239
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:58,010
'Because it's not just you, it's the entire
neighbourhood that she has satisfied'

240
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,050
Husband faints.

241
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,800
- Dev my man.
- Sir.

242
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,550
I've got a present for you.

243
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,890
I bought this during my college time..

244
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,100
..at George Town, Kentucky..

245
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,050
It got me through my darkest hours.

246
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,800
And now, it's yours.

247
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,050
Sir.

248
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,100
Take it.

249
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,470
The point is that now you need it.

250
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,390
I know you're reeling under a lot
of pressure of your Home Loan.

251
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,930
Sir.

252
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,050
- And you've raise due as well.
- Sir.

253
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,800
But, I can't give you a raise
at this time.

254
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,850
Sir..m..my..my EMI..

255
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,760
- Sir, my EMIs are..
- I get it.

256
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,390
- My..
- No, no, I get it.

257
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,430
But the company is
going through a transition..

258
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,100
..for it's ultimate glory.

259
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,010
And we need all the funds.

260
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,930
First of all;
Our sales are an all-time low.

261
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,300
And we're up against
our greatest threat.

262
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,010
The jet-spray.

263
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,470
Typical middle-class invention.

264
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Have you tried it?

265
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,970
Have you tried it?

266
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,470
What, sir?

267
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
The jet-spray.

268
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,890
No, sir.

269
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,850
- Should I?
- No!

270
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,220
It's disgusting.

271
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,850
Half the time's wasted
in trying to aim.

272
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,680
Such a waste of water.

273
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,640
Sit-sit-sit.

274
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,010
I've got to stop it at all cost, Dev.

275
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,050
For the future of the next generation.

276
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,800
Because I care.

277
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,470
And I know you do too.

278
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,100
Before..I saw your eyes open.

279
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,300
No, sir, it was just a pin that..

280
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,100
You see, the Third World War..

281
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,890
..will be fought for water.

282
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,930
And the only thing
that can save it, is this.

283
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,260
Do you want to see
the Third World War, Dev?

284
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,600
Huh, Dev?

285
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,430
No, sir.

286
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,220
Yeah..exactly..

287
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,600
And that's why I have decided..

288
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,220
..that you'll be leading
our new toilet-paper campaign.

289
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,100
This is much better than a raise, Dev.

290
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,720
So make sure you shake it up, Dev.

291
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,470
Alright.

292
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,470
Shake it up!

293
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,550
Hello, is that Mr. Dev speaking?

294
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,050
This is Vaishali speaking from
New Bombay Co-operative Bank!

295
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,100
Sir, your last month's EMI is due.

296
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,300
When will you make payment?

297
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,390
'Did you pay for the
Dhanadhan Tv subscription?'

298
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,850
'Surprise.. Someday he'll
come barging inside saying that!'

299
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,180
'The company is going
through a transition.'

300
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,220
'And we'll be gasping.'

301
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,720
'I can't give you a raise right now.'

302
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,720
'Ranjit Arora..'

303
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,050
'Dolly Verma's husband.'

304
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,600
'How does he look?'

305
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,260
'Like a husband.'

306
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,010
'When will you make payment?'
Tomorrow or day after..

307
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,970
Hello.

308
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,220
Day after..

309
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,010
Sir, cash or cheque?

310
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,550
Hello.

311
00:32:59,470 --> 00:32:59,970
Cash!

312
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,010
- Morning or evening?
- Evening!

313
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,300
Thank you sir.

314
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,180
It's got dual-sim, radio,
LED torch, 20 hour battery life.

315
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,010
Only 1500.

316
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,260
1500?

317
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,100
Fine, I'll take it.

318
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,600
And a prepaid sim-card as well.

319
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,510
"Revenge!"

320
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:05,220
He could've sold credit-cards
or even underwear..

321
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,640
But toilet paper?

322
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,010
Fine..I know it's
nothing to brag about..

323
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,930
..but, it's not all that bad.

324
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,180
You know..

325
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,600
You were really hasty
in getting married.

326
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,680
What?

327
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,350
I got married in a haste?

328
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,930
What did you say to me?

329
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm going to Igatpuri
for four weeks to learn Yoga.

330
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,930
But you returned after 6
months with a Mercedes and a wife.

331
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,470
And I was hasty?

332
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,300
Speak up.

333
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,600
Soy milk reduces cholesterol. Try it.

334
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,470
Shut up.

335
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,680
Idiot.

336
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,640
It's such a pain to read these texts.

337
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,300
Ma..Married..

338
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,930
Married woman..

339
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,930
Affair!

340
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,260
Text: Affair with a married woman??

341
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,720
Text: What do you want?

342
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,510
He's not picking up.

343
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,260
Who is it?

344
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,600
He is asking for just 100,000!

345
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,510
- Do you have 100,000?
- No!

346
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,140
- Then how is it 'just' 100,000?
- Yeah..

347
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,890
Correct!

348
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,510
Who can it be?

349
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,510
I don't know.

350
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,850
Damn, He wants it tomorrow!

351
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,600
Just pay him.

352
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,430
- Pay him?
- Yes.

353
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,300
I don't even have money for protein powder.
There is no money.

354
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,050
Then ask your wife.

355
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,140
You married her for money right?

356
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,430
No money.

357
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,430
You know I am treated
like a dog in that house.

358
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,350
I get meat only on Sundays.

359
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,430
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

360
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,930
Ranjit, please.

361
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,430
Your wife is our only hope. You get it!

362
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,300
Do something.. anything..

363
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,850
Make some excuse, or cook up a story..

364
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,140
..but you have to do something,
or else we'll get in big trouble.

365
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,010
What if Dev finds out?

366
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,180
He says he'll tell Dolly.

367
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,470
- S***
- Ranjit! Ranjit!

368
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,300
"Teach the king a lesson."

369
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,970
"Show him the might of a knight."

370
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:20,220
"Go on a picnic with the queen."

371
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,510
Baby..

372
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,640
Baby?

373
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,550
Last time you called
me 'baby' was in 2010.

374
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,930
Back then you wanted a Mercedes.

375
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,510
What do you want now freeloader?

376
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,220
Exactly.

377
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,850
I am tired of begging.

378
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,510
From You! From Papa.

379
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,010
I've finally decided.

380
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,260
I'm going to start my own business.

381
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,390
But..

382
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,180
Business?

383
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,390
Okay..

384
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,350
What business?

385
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,140
Huh?

386
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,010
What business are you going to do?

387
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,300
Import business.

388
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,430
Only import. And no export.

389
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,350
No..I'll export as well.

390
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,640
Import and Export.

391
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,600
Okay.

392
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,140
So what are you going to import
and what will you export?

393
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,430
So what are you going to import..

394
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,010
..and what will you export, you dog?

395
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,180
Dogs!

396
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,180
Huh!

397
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,430
Dogs!

398
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,180
I'll import them from Taiwan..

399
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,680
..and export them to China.

400
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,010
It's got a great scope.
No one else is doing it.

401
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,800
I have a friend who's a dog breeder..

402
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,350
..and he has all the information.

403
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,930
We are in it together.

404
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,890
Which friend?

405
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,470
That..Dev

406
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,220
Dev..

407
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,430
Why are you sc*** up poor Dev's life?

408
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,140
Dolly, listen..

409
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,470
I want to change..

410
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,640
Honestly.

411
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,850
For me.

412
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,470
For you.

413
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,760
For us!

414
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,350
And guess, what I need for all this?

415
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,390
Just 100,000 rupees.

416
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,300
There..now you're showing
your true colors.

417
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,800
Baby, if I was sc*** with you..

418
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,100
..would I have said anything
less than 5 million?

419
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,510
Think?

420
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,720
Am I going to lie for 100,000?

421
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,550
Please, baby.

422
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,260
Please..

423
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,300
I'll think about it.

424
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,680
Huh!

425
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,510
I'll think about it.

426
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,390
Okay.

427
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,430
I said Hello!

428
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,550
To Whom?

429
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,350
The new girl...

430
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,300
Prabha.

431
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,510
She's a very decent girl.

432
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,100
I am sure she has never
French-kissed in her life.

433
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,180
Girls who French-kiss have puffy lips.

434
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,140
But her lips are very delicate, sweet.

435
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,970
There she is.

436
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,350
- Prabha.
- Yeah.

437
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Have you met Dev?

438
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,260
- Hi.
- Nice meeting you.

439
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,640
In case you need anything..

440
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,720
..or you need help with something...
you can ask Dev.

441
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,100
Of course...after all you're heading
the new campaign.

442
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:51,850
Yeah.

443
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,260
We will talk later.

444
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,300
Cool..
See you then.

445
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,220
Some rascal stole my wife's photo.

446
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,140
Who, sir?

447
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,390
Come, let me show you.

448
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,100
That MOFO..Pandey.

449
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,470
He lusts after my wife.

450
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,470
I have seen it in his eyes.

451
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,220
But sir, Pandey..

452
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,220
You just keep an
eye on him for me. Okay.

453
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:33,800
Yes, sir.

454
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,680
Alright.

455
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,930
Now let's get to work.

456
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,100
Something incredible happened today.

457
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,890
This morning, I was using
the toilet paper like always..

458
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,640
..when suddenly, I had an epiphany.

459
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,180
An idea which will make people..

460
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,010
..desperate to buy our toilet paper.

461
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,470
Guns don't kill people, bullets do.

462
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,430
Without the bullet,
the gun won't fire.

463
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,350
You get it.

464
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,010
- I get it.
- Alright.

465
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,550
Now, on the day of
our product launch..

466
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,350
..you'll turn off the water
supply for this entire area.

467
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,220
I will turn off the water supply
for this entire area?

468
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,100
Me?
I can't do it, sir.

469
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:31,550
Dev..a woman in
Jharkhand married a dog.

470
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,600
- Sir..
- Dev.. Dev..

471
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,800
This is India. Anything is possible.

472
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,100
So..go to the Municipal
Commissioner's office..

473
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,890
..and get it done.

474
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,260
Cut off the water supply.

475
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,300
And let's see how these
people wash their backside.

476
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,720
Seriously..Jharkhand.

477
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,720
That reminds me of an incredible joke.

478
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,970
These days there's a very popular
cougar joke doing rounds...

479
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,100
Name's Moon.

480
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,760
Pappu returns from school
and tells aunt Moon.

481
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,760
Aunt Moon..
Aunt Moon...

482
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,800
- You know the teacher today..
- I'll tell you a joke today.

483
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,390
- Huh..
- I'll tell you a joke today.

484
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,930
Listen..

485
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,850
You?

486
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,970
- You're going to tell a joke.
- Just listen.

487
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,140
- No, no, no..
- Just listen.

488
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,800
Fine..tell me.

489
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,180
Hold on..

490
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,220
- Now tell me.
- One day..

491
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,640
..a husband returns
home early from work..

492
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,640
..with flowers to surprise his wife.

493
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,680
Flower

494
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,720
He gets home.

495
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,970
But in the bedroom..

496
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,680
..he sees his wife is
sleeping with another man.

497
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,510
What the.. That's my kind of joke.

498
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,600
Listen..

499
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,640
Yeah, what next.

500
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,760
- Guess what the husband does next?
- What?

501
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,890
The husband starts
blackmailing the guy.

502
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,010
Your wife?

503
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,100
Oh my, God.

504
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,100
Ohh...that rose day?

505
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,640
Why didn't you
catch her red-handed?

506
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,260
I want to teach them a lesson.

507
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,890
Ohh for god's sake...

508
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,100
That guy was bonking your wife.

509
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,100
Why didn't you beat him up?

510
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,720
I don't like violence.

511
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:55,100
Great... You don't like violence
but you are okay with blackmail?

512
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,180
Because I need the money.

513
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,010
Hold on..

514
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,550
Do you want to teach him
a lesson or take money from him?

515
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,600
Both.

516
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,430
Both.

517
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,640
Buddy..

518
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,850
I've seen in films..

519
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:28,050
Its people like you who turn out
to be the serial killer in the end.

520
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,390
How much did you ask for?

521
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,430
"Revenge."

522
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,050
"When life screws your plans.
Embarrasses you, my man."

523
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,680
"Plays you like a fiddle.
Makes and example out of you."

524
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,930
"When you're out for revenge
and you're hit below the belt.."

525
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,430
"You see the devil in beloved's face"

526
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,550
"Only one way to get out."

527
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,890
"Dump your problems on someone else,
your happiness, his fear."

528
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,050
"Forget the rest and do what you care."

529
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,350
"Your life is yours to bear."

530
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:25,010
"Life's going to stab you in the back
stick it all the way across."

531
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,850
"It's going to tear up your plans.
So be prepared.."

532
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,390
"No one knows which way
the world spins."

533
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,760
"The crow takes the shine,
and the crane's polluted.."

534
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,140
"Money's the main factor here,
creating a stir."

535
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,600
"This jungle's disdain.
Your loss is his gain."

536
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,140
"Don't be greedy,
What is the worth of money."

537
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,600
"You're smart, you know it,
don't let the out of your head."

538
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,350
"Like a butterfly chasing a cheater."

539
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,550
"They look decent,
but inside they are evil."

540
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,550
"Make them all pay.."

541
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,640
"Keep all the money for yourself."

542
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,390
"It's the new rule of life.
- Cheat your own people."

543
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,850
"You must beat your own people,
in order to win."

544
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,930
"Game on baby."

545
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,470
"Revenge."

546
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,510
"Who won, and who lost."

547
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,010
"Flip a coin and do a toss."

548
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,720
"The world is unforgiving,
so don't be Santa Claus."

549
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,140
"He's dipping his chips, in your sauce."

550
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,510
"Cross plus double cross."

551
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,350
"The world's unforgiving,
it deserves to be taught a lesson."

552
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,850
"It deserves to be taught a lesson."

553
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,510
"It deserves to be taught a lesson."

554
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,510
"Revenge."

555
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,930
"Revenge."

556
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,600
"Revenge."

557
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,140
"Revenge."

558
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,050
He wasn't ready to believe it.

559
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,390
It was really incredible,
Dolly, you know..

560
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,970
Import-Export!

561
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,260
Yes, papa.

562
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,010
Dolly told me..

563
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,550
..that you're going to start an
import-export business.

564
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,140
Yes, papa.

565
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,260
Bravo, son.

566
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,220
Dolly, I always knew
he'll do something so great..

567
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,220
..that I will be forced
to proudly shake hands with him.

568
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,100
Dolly dear, get me a drink.

569
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,390
You dog, your entire family..

570
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,220
..rummaged leftovers
from the garbage.

571
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:50,930
And you will do import-export?

572
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,390
You pulled a fast one on my daughter.

573
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,390
But don't try to fool me.

574
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,470
You know my history, don't you?

575
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,550
I tried to get you killed three times.

576
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,470
But, thanks to my
daughter's prayers..

577
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,100
..you survived every time.

578
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,600
If you don't return
this money in three days..

579
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:14,260
I will make sure the prayers
go unheard this time.

580
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,930
Malti.

581
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,970
Get the ice.

582
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,760
- What's going on?
- Handshake.

583
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,850
Happy Anniversary Dolly dear.

584
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,550
Happy Diwali Dolly dear.

585
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,970
Happy Birthday.

586
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,050
- Yes, papa.
- Smile, please.

587
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:58,800
E-mail: Affair with a married man

588
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:04,050
E-mail: I want 1,20,000/- or I will tell Dev

589
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,010
The entire city is
demanding more water..

590
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:16,300
And this guy wants me to shut
the water supply for an entire day.

591
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,470
Not the entire day.

592
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,430
10 pm to 10 am.

593
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,760
12 hours..

594
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:25,800
There's a guy protesting
outside my office..

595
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,140
..because he didn't get
water supply for four hours.

596
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,680
Mister..I don't want
to turn my office..

597
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,260
..into a protest area, understand.

598
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,970
I thought we'll do as you say..

599
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,220
A little give and take..

600
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,220
What did you say?

601
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,550
- You did.
- No.

602
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,180
Come back later.

603
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,510
Hey..

604
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,850
Sit down. Sit down.

605
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
I said sit down.

606
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:58,430
Go on.

607
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,050
Yes.

608
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,640
You know I think it's awesome!

609
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,470
I had one idea..

610
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,640
Just a moment.

611
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,390
Hey Dev..

612
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,430
Yeah, sir..

613
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,300
It's difficult.

614
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,260
He's demanding 2.4 million.

615
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,100
That's a great deal.

616
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,720
Sir..I said 2.4 million.

617
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,180
That's 200,000 per hour.

618
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,300
Dev, you're a brilliant salesmen..

619
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,430
..but you have no
clue about business.

620
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,850
Mark my words.

621
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,550
My marketing strategy..

622
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,720
..will be taught in Princeton,
Harvard, and Cambridge.

623
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,260
So shake on it, Dev. Shake on it.

624
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,720
I've got two words.

625
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,300
Russian Blondes.

626
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,180
'Okay stand straight.'

627
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,430
'Super.. Now put your
hand on the shoulder.'

628
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,550
What kind of place is this, Ranjit?

629
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,050
Where else could we meet?

630
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,930
This is the safest place.

631
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:04,930
Listen..

632
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,600
We're getting blackmailed
by the same guy.

633
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,350
Really?

634
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,350
Look at the message.

635
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,890
Both the messages
are in the same style.

636
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,350
Hindi spelled in English

637
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:20,430
Yeah..

638
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:26,390
But where will I get 120,000 rupees?

639
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,890
We can't go to the
Police either, right?

640
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,470
Police.. not at all.

641
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,800
You had a job before marriage, right?

642
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,140
You must have some savings.

643
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,850
What savings?

644
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,220
I guess...its hardly 30,000.

645
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,550
We still need 90,000/-

646
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:47,550
You have to pay.

647
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,470
Mom, I need some money.

648
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,550
90,000!

649
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,640
90,000?

650
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,100
Have you seen our condition?

651
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,600
We've nothing left.

652
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,970
We've sold everything
for your father's treatment.

653
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,100
And now he's even lost
control on his bladder.

654
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,890
I've to make these
adult diapers for him.

655
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,430
In fact,
Dev should be lending us a hand..

656
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,100
..but, he wants to
borrow from us instead.

657
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,850
He's only asking for a loan.

658
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,140
He will pay it back.

659
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,390
Pass me bobbin..

660
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,640
If that scoundrel Ranjit
hadn't ditched you..

661
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,260
..we wouldn't have forced
you to marry Dev.

662
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,010
Who knew there's a rascal
behind that innocent face?

663
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,180
Please, mom.

664
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,680
Can you lend me the money?

665
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,470
You know what..

666
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,100
..sell your father's kidney.

667
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,180
Drinking water again.

668
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,010
How many times do you drink water?

669
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,930
The doctor has advised you against it.

670
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,300
But why sell my kidney?

671
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,050
Forget it.

672
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:05,640
Dev..

673
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,510
Dev, I needed 90,000.

674
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,350
90,000? But why?

675
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,550
Papa needs to get some tests done.

676
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:19,220
What test cost 90,000?

677
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:21,970
Angiography.

678
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,640
Dev..I wouldn't have asked
if it wasn't for father.

679
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,550
Please.

680
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,300
Fine, I'll give you tomorrow.

681
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,350
Congratulations, buddy.

682
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,180
Prabha has agreed for a date.

683
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,680
I am taking her to our usual bar..

684
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:46,930
..that's where I'll get her drunk.

685
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,140
She's a virgin,
after all, that's the way it's done.

686
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:51,010
Same old trick.

687
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,680
One coke bottle and
four large vodkas.

688
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,220
Doesn't smell, you know.

689
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,970
And then..I'm going
test the suspension of my car.

690
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,350
That's called rape.

691
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:07,640
What..

692
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,430
Yeah right..

693
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,850
..as if you are doing social service.

694
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,050
Blackmailer.

695
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:16,890
Right?

696
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:20,930
What did you call me?

697
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,100
Don't you dare say that word again?

698
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,390
You better forget..

699
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,930
..everything that
I told you yesterday.

700
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,010
I have.

701
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:31,100
What?

702
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,140
I forgot.

703
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:35,100
I mean..

704
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,220
I am only joking, dude.

705
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,760
Look at your face.

706
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,970
Okay listen.

707
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,680
- Have you ever done it in a car?
- A car?

708
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:51,430
Yeah, baby..

709
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,510
Dev gave me the money.

710
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,300
Dev's a really great guy.

711
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,260
We must pay the blackmailer tonight.

712
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,550
I know..

713
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,050
How are you going to get there?

714
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,850
I've borrowed my friend's car.
What difference does it make?

715
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,430
Are you coming along?

716
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,510
Me..?

717
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,140
No, I've to take Dolly out for dinner.

718
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:13,510
Ranjit, please. I am scared!

719
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:15,800
There's no need to be scared.

720
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,430
They are dogs after all.

721
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:18,850
- What?
- Even if they bite you..

722
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,180
..you'll just need a rabies shot,
that's all.

723
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,430
Be there on time.

724
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,680
- Hello?
- Okay..okay, bye-bye.

725
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,050
What?

726
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,800
That was my business partner.

727
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,350
The dogs have arrived.

728
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:30,760
Good.

729
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,600
Which breed?

730
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,300
Chihuahua.

731
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,850
Text: 90,000/- tonight...
at Kharghar Circle

732
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,680
S***

733
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,970
Customs have detained our dogs.

734
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,140
I must go.

735
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,640
Your tea, sir.

736
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,350
"I swear I'm going to make you pay."

737
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,050
"I loved you so much
but you never cared."

738
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,600
"I know it tastes bitter
but it's the most effective."

739
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,390
"We're no longer one soul."

740
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:29,220
"No more running behind you I'm going
to get everything back you stole."

741
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,430
"Love maybe lost and there's
just darkness in my heart."

742
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,760
"I loved you so much
but you didn't love me."

743
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,470
"I was yours,
but you were never mine.."

744
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:36,680
"..and loved someone else."

745
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,100
"I admit..you looked pretty naive."

746
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,300
"Game on baby.."

747
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,140
"Game on.."

748
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,100
"Revenge."

749
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,390
"Truth is always bitter
only revenge is sweet."

750
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,760
"I am gonna give you a shock
in return for all the pain."

751
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,140
"It's gonna scare you every time."

752
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,260
"You will want to run away."

753
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,010
"Every step you take will only
cause you pain."

754
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,260
"It will kill you slowly-silently
and turn your life hell."

755
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,550
"I admit..you looked pretty naive.
Yes my wife."

756
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,850
"Game on baby.."

757
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,550
"Revenge."

758
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,800
"Through the heart, and straight across.."

759
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:29,220
"Sick of this fake live."

760
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,010
"I am going to make you pay
for this deceit, my love.."

761
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,390
"Dare you rejected my love.."

762
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,760
"Now you must face my disapproval?

763
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,220
"I won't let you off so easily.."

764
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,720
"Before I've had my revenge.."

765
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,220
"Before I've had my revenge.."

766
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,510
"Revenge."

767
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,800
Yes sir, this way.

768
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:50,970
They've decorated the place today.

769
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:51,600
Sir.

770
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,640
Isn't this a nice place?

771
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,640
Sit down.

772
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:55,680
Your order sir.

773
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,930
One large vodka and a soft drink.

774
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,010
Excuse me. Aren't you going to drink?

775
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,300
No, I am..

776
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,140
- Waiter, two large vodkas.
- Yes sir.

777
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Mili!

778
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,390
Hi!

779
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:15,510
Beautiful.

780
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,300
Mili.

781
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:22,140
"She pierced my heart..with a knife."

782
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:32,050
"She pierced my heart..with a knife."

783
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:37,430
"She slowly..ruined my life."

784
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:42,640
"Spent the night in someone's arms.."

785
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,640
"..and robbed me of every
penny before leaving."

786
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,600
"Two-timing beauty.."

787
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,970
"..cheated on me."

788
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,760
"Two-timing beauty.."

789
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,010
"..cheated on me."

790
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:00,050
"Lying beloved.."

791
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,350
"..cheated on me."

792
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:07,600
Seafood.

793
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,220
- Do you like fish?
- Yes..

794
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:11,680
Pomfret.

795
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,350
- I love when it's deep fried..
- Not that.

796
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,260
Pet fish. Goldfish.

797
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:18,600
I have two..

798
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,510
Sonu and Sonia.

799
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,100
Do you want to see?

800
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:30,680
"On the whole..the beloved
had good etiquettes.."

801
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,600
"..but sweetheart
was a little impolite."

802
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,010
"You were a decent guy.."

803
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,300
"..but she made you helpless."

804
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,720
Stop-stop-stop.

805
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,600
Do you like jokes?

806
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,140
There's a new cougar joke doing rounds..

807
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,220
Her names Aunt Moon.

808
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,260
Pappu returns from school,
and tells her Aunt Moon...

809
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,430
'Aunt Moon, my teacher asked me..

810
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,600
'What you want to do when you grow up?'

811
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:03,050
Do you know what I said?

812
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,050
I said, teacher when I grow up..

813
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,510
- ..'I am going to get on top of Moon, and..
- Yuck!

814
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,760
"Cheated on me."

815
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,050
- Come on, let's go.
- No-no-no..

816
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,800
I'll tell you a decent one.

817
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,680
- This one's really decent.
- No, no, we're already late..

818
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,680
Please..please..

819
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,720
Hear it while you finish your drink.

820
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,850
Yeah..

821
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,100
Decent one..

822
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:42,600
Once a husband goes home early
with flowers to surprise his wife.

823
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,180
As soon he gets home..

824
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:49,350
..he sees his wife's
in bed with another man..

825
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,470
No, no, no, this one's really decent.
Just let me finish.

826
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,350
Do you know what
the husband does next?

827
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,850
He starts blackmailing
his wife's boyfriend.

828
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,140
What kind of a joke is that?

829
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,970
That's exactly what I told Dev.

830
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,930
Blackmailing your wife's
boyfriend is not a joke..

831
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,600
Hold on.

832
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:22,180
Dev..is blackmailing
his wife's boyfriend.

833
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,430
And the boyfriend doesn't know
that it's Dev.

834
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,890
Has he asked for money?

835
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,350
How much?

836
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:37,300
50?

837
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:39,970
50..

838
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,760
He's demanded 100,000!

839
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,390
I see.

840
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:49,930
Prabha..

841
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,970
- Prabha..
- Yes.

842
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,140
Please don't tell anyone.

843
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,510
- It's a big secret.
- I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.

844
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,470
- Swear?
- Swear.

845
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,890
Finish your drink.

846
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,890
Then we'll go see your goldfish.

847
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,220
"Two-timing beauty.."

848
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,350
"..cheated on me."

849
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:18,220
"Two-timing beauty.."

850
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,350
"..cheated on me."

851
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,430
"Lying beloved.."

852
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:26,680
"..cheated on me."

853
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:45,850
Water covers 71% of the earth.

854
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,140
But did you know that
only Less than 2% of it..

855
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:53,100
..is available to 7 billion
people and millions of species..

856
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,640
..we share the planet with.

857
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,760
Without water,
life on earth can't survive.

858
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:03,260
So let's join our hands
and pledge to save our water.

859
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,970
Let's pledge to use toilet paper.

860
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,470
My Handy Toilet paper..

861
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,640
Save water, Save the planet.

862
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,550
So..what do you think?

863
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,550
It's awesome, I know.

864
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,510
I got 18 product inquiries
from all over the country.

865
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,970
My Handy is buzzing.

866
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,800
Bait!

867
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:38,140
Bait?

868
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,800
I've installed a CCTV
camera in this room.

869
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,220
Where?

870
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:47,140
I don't think you can spot it.

871
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:50,930
Eagle.

872
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,220
Eagle?

873
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
Bald Eagle.

874
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,550
Bald Eagle?

875
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,100
Now let's see how that
Pandey escapes this?

876
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,720
- Buddy, his wife's photos...
- Come with me.

877
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:58,850
Buddy.

878
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:03,010
What are you doing?
Why are you hitting me?

879
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,140
- Are you blackmailing me?
- Why will I blackmail you?

880
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,510
- Who left this on my table?
- My hand..

881
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,930
- Who left this on my table?
- Not me.

882
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:13,600
You didn't..

883
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,390
- Not me.
- Then who did?

884
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:16,100
- I don't know.
- You bloody..

885
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,260
- Not my right hand.
- Who did you tell?

886
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,760
I didn't tell anyone.

887
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:21,680
Prabha. Prabha.

888
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,510
Maybe.. Maybe..I told Prabha.

889
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,760
You told Prabha?

890
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,640
I was really drunk yesterday.

891
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,300
- You told Prabha?
- Yes, maybe.

892
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,800
I was really drunk yesterday.

893
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,100
Maybe I blurted it when I was drunk.

894
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,350
What did you tell her?

895
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,680
I don't remember.

896
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,970
She is really b***

897
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,220
- She drinks more than me.
- Oh my god!

898
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,550
Even my wallet is missing
from last night.

899
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,550
Oh my, God.

900
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,100
I don't think she's a virgin either.

901
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,470
Okay..only one month
left for the product launch.

902
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:52,300
I want the presentation ready.

903
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:53,930
- Prabha. Prabha.
- I've to show sir..

904
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,010
Prabha, come here.

905
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,220
Just a second, sir.

906
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,640
I want the entire presentation
ready after the lunch break.

907
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,760
Assemble the entire team,
do whatever you have to..

908
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:02,470
I am calling you,
it will just take a second.

909
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,180
We'll continue..

910
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,010
- Come.
- Yes, sir.

911
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,760
- You think you're very smart.
- No, sir.

912
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,430
What happened?

913
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:13,930
Who wrote this?

914
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,550
I don't know..it wasn't me.

915
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,970
- Come here..
- Excuse me, sir..

916
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:22,010
Do you think you're too smart?

917
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,890
- Who do you think..
- Hey..

918
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:26,930
I've been enduring
for a while now..

919
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,350
And you are disrespecting me.

920
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,970
I'm calling you sir, ain't I?

921
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:31,300
So show some respect.

922
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:33,220
What is your problem?
Are you going to scream at me?

923
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,720
Are you going to scream at me?

924
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,850
- Are you?
- Did I scream? Did I?

925
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:39,760
- I don't say that.
- Then what is this? What is this?

926
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:42,140
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

927
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,390
Isn't that a stupid question?
I want money.

928
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,470
I don't have money..I don't..

929
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,050
- You don't have?
- No I don't have.

930
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,600
- So you won't give?
- No, I won't.

931
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,600
Fine, don't give..

932
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,430
I'll send a similar note to your wife.

933
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,470
Is that fine?

934
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:00,140
Look..I'll kick you so hard.

935
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,600
Don't try to intimidate me.

936
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:28,140
What?

937
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,680
Answer me.

938
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,430
Should I send a note to your wife?

939
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,640
Should I?

940
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,050
How much?

941
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,550
60,000.

942
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,550
- 20,000
- 50,000

943
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,720
- 25,000
- 40,000

944
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,600
- 30..final.
- Done!

945
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,930
This is the last time.

946
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,680
Excuse me, sir.

947
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,390
You look really cute
when you're angry.

948
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,430
30! 30!

949
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:14,350
Here's 20,000.

950
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,300
And the rest?

951
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,550
I'll return it in a month.

952
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,600
Seven days.

953
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,800
- Father..
- Five days.

954
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,180
- But..
- Four days.

956

E-mail: 40,000/- Rs Tonight

959
01:11:54,550 --> 01:12:01,430
Text: Need 40,000 more

960
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:47,220
"You have no shame."

961
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:52,100
"You've a strange character."

962
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,800
"You numbskull.."

963
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:58,970
"Who brought you in this world?

964
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,390
"Revenge.."

965
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,550
"Revenge.."

966
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,100
This is the first and last time, okay.

967
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,680
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

968
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,600
Pandey!

969
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:31,010
Aghh..get out.

970
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,140
I should've known..

971
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:41,720
..these poor, security guard,
type people can't afford boxers.

972
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:42,720
Yes, sir.

973
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:49,220
It's some other office employee.

974
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,680
Yes, sir.

975
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:54,430
But who?

976
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,600
Look-Look-Look..

977
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,760
It's the same girl from last time..

978
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,970
..but, with a different guy.

979
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,300
Ranjit, please focus.

980
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,550
What's the point?

981
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,680
Listen, I have an idea.

982
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:17,100
Why don't we hire a private detective?

983
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,390
Have you lost your mind?
Private detective!

984
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,890
We'll get into a lot of trouble.

985
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,050
Then please do something.

986
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,050
I cannot ask Dev for more money.

987
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,970
It's okay, it's alright..

988
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,970
Destiny cannot be averted.

989
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,970
We're merely puppets
in the hands of destiny.

990
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:15,550
We were eating a meal together.

991
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:18,140
It's okay, it's alright..

992
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:23,470
We were eating a meal together.
And now he is no more..

993
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,100
What were you eating?

994
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,010
Kidney beans and rice.

995
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:32,970
You shouldn't be eating kidney beans
and rice..

996
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,550
In fact, you shouldn't eat kidney
beans at all. It upsets the stomach.

997
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,100
We haven't eaten kidney beans
for the last 10 years.

998
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:41,430
Control yourself..

999
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:42,470
I am right here.

1000
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,260
By the way, how did you know it's me?

1001
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,430
Tell me.

1002
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,300
Do you suspect anyone?

1003
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:04,800
What's the reason for blackmail?

1004
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:08,390
"Affair with a married woman."

1005
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,640
- It just happened.
- It's okay.

1006
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,430
So..you must have a wife too.

1007
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:16,140
How do you know?

1008
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,300
Most of Chawla's cases are like that.

1009
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,430
Boy with girl.. Girl with boy..

1010
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,550
These days a lot of boys with boys too..

1011
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,470
Dogs, cats, cattle, sheep..
No one's safe these days.

1012
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:28,010
- You know, in Jharkhand..
- I get it.

1013
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:32,140
All I want to know is whether
you can find the blackmailer or not.

1014
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:33,640
Hold this.

1015
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,050
Look..

1016
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,260
Read the third line.

1017
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,010
97% success..

1018
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,430
97% success rate!

1019
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:45,680
I hope I won't fall under the 3%

1020
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,430
- Let it be..
- No Sir..

1021
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:50,970
Fees?

1022
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,930
20,000!

1023
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,850
10,000 advance.
10,000 after the job.

1024
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:57,470
Plus daily allowance.
Food, traveling, internet package.

1025
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,300
If you pay by cheque or RTGS..

1026
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:00,720
..then you'll be charged
18% GST.

1027
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,720
You can also get a bill if you want.
But with 5% Vat extra.

1028
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:05,680
It's too much.

1029
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,640
It goes to the government,
we have no cut.

1030
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,930
The fee is too much.

1031
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,970
Not more than what you're paying
the blackmailer.

1032
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,600
So pay up.

1033
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,390
Here?

1034
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,140
Yeah, they are all like family.
No need to worry.

1035
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:31,430
What will you do if I find
the blackmailer's name?

1036
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,850
I'll shoot him.

1037
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,010
You're very lucky.

1038
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,680
I must say very lucky.

1039
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,140
Why?

1040
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,300
Chawla even deals in guns.

1041
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,220
I see..

1042
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,550
By the way..where is Chawla?

1043
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:54,100
Uncle..

1044
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,010
No, son!

1045
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,890
Dev sir, for you.

1046
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:06,470
Who gave it?

1047
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,010
Prabha madam..who works in our office.

1048
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,550
Where is she?

1049
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,970
She didn't come today.
Sick leave.

1050
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,970
She threw a party last night.
She invited everyone.

1051
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:22,640
Didn't she invite you?

1052
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,640
Fine.

1053
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,510
Yes, sir.

1054
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:38,680
Bablu..I need details of a number.

1055
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,100
Stop showing attitude..

1056
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,260
Fine, I'll pay you 1000 rupees.

1057
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:44,720
Note down the number.

1058
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,350
885..

1059
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:49,930
Come, buddy.

1060
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:55,800
Listen..where does Prabha stay?

1061
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:58,970
You too.

1062
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:00,760
Last night I told you she's a..

1063
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,350
Just give me her address!

1064
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,760
What is it, Dev?

1065
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,180
We need to talk.

1066
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,680
Did you bring my money?

1067
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,800
That's what we need to talk about.

1068
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,510
There won't be any negotiation.

1069
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,600
Open the door I need to talk to you.

1070
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,640
Fine, I'm opening the door.

1071
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,550
Bablu, you took really long.

1072
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:44,680
What? Did you find him?

1073
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,640
What's his name?

1074
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:48,850
Dev..

1075
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:50,350
Dev Kaushal.

1076
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,010
Great..

1077
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,260
Thank you.

1078
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,260
Why did you stop?

1079
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,010
Speak up, and make it quick.
What is it?

1080
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,850
Look, I cannot give
you any more money.

1081
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,680
I am already under a lot of pressure
to pay my loans for home, car..

1082
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,180
Your home's already broken.

1083
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,680
And you don't have to pay anyway.

1084
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,300
You are demanding the money
from your wife's boyfriend, right?

1085
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:12,470
So just add my share as well. Simple.

1086
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,970
I cannot ask for more money.

1087
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:16,550
Then don't..

1088
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,720
Sell your house.

1089
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,180
I want my money.

1090
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:42,010
What?

1091
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:43,890
Not again.

1092
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,180
Look at me and talk.

1093
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,550
When will you pay me?

1094
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,140
- I won't give you any more money.
- Huh.

1095
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,260
- I won't give you any more money.
- You won't.

1096
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:57,720
Yes, I won't give any more money.

1097
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,390
- Are you sure?
- You can do anything you want.

1098
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:00,640
I can do anything.

1099
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,550
Then I'm going to tear my clothes..

1100
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,800
..and scream that you're raping me.

1101
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:06,390
- Help!
- No, no, no.

1102
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:07,970
- Anybody there!
- No, no, no.

1103
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,470
- Anybody there!
- No, no, no.

1104
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:12,760
Fine..

1105
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,550
So? When will you pay me?

1106
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,260
I'm leaving.

1107
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,930
Where..where are you going?
My money..

1108
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:49,720
Prabha.

1109
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,430
Wait. Wait.

1110
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,550
Asleep so soon?

1111
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,300
She knows we're coming.

1112
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:25,850
Prabha dear.

1113
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,300
I had a spare key.

1114
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:35,640
Open the door, dear.

1115
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,930
Yes I'm searching.

1116
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,640
Wait a minute.

1117
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,640
Found it. Found it. Here..

1118
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:07,350
Prabha!

1119
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,100
Prabha! Prabha!

1120
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,850
Hey Stop him!

1121
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,430
Stop!

1122
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:20,260
Stop!

1123
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,680
Hey catch him.

1124
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:25,760
Catch him!

1125
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,760
Stop!

1126
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,800
Where is he? Look there.

1127
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:43,350
Hey catch him!

1128
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,600
He must be somewhere around.
Find him.

1129
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:48,010
I think he went in the back alley.

1130
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,600
Let's go.

1131
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,180
Stop there.

1132
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,600
Hey catch him!

1133
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,930
Look there also.

1134
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:00,850
Mister, did you see
a nude guy run past here.

1135
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:03,180
Nude.. No, but someone ran
past here in an underwear.

1136
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:05,350
Guys, he went this way.

1137
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:06,350
He went this way.

1138
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:33,300
She just joined us recently.

1139
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,220
This week?

1140
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,640
Yes sir.

1141
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:38,390
Okay.

1142
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,140
Prabha.

1143
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,550
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

1144
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,100
Shinde, take everyone's statement.

1145
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:47,970
Yes sir.

1146
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:52,470
What happened?

1147
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,220
Come to the cabin.

1148
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,850
Coffee? Tea?

1149
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,390
What's going on?

1150
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:08,010
- You killed her, didn't you?
- Who?

1151
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:08,760
I knew it..

1152
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,470
Guys like you turn out
to be the serial killer.

1153
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:11,640
Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?

1154
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,550
- Prabha.
- What happened to her?

1155
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,430
How did you kill her?

1156
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:14,470
Did you strangle her?

1157
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:17,300
- Did you butcher her?
- No..

1158
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:18,970
I will tell everyone.
I will tell the Police.

1159
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:19,970
I'll tell the boss.

1160
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:23,430
- Anand.. I swear I didn't even meet her.
- You are lying.

1161
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:25,600
- No, no, I..
- You're lying, dude.

1162
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:27,760
You know she was such a hottie.

1163
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,970
We could have..

1164
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:33,680
Hello.

1165
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:36,930
Yes.

1166
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:39,640
It's definitely soft.

1167
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:42,050
Yes, it's 3-ply technology.

1168
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,470
Dev, please come in.

1169
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,350
Meet Inspector Rawle.

1170
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,550
He's investigating
Prabha's murder case.

1171
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,930
Inspector Rawle,
this is Dev, my right-hand man.

1172
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:55,220
Did you know Prabha?

1173
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:59,550
I mean..I didn't know her well.

1174
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,640
She joined a few days back.

1175
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,640
So you guys were not close?

1176
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:04,890
What..?

1177
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,430
I mean, you two didn't talk much.

1178
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:11,680
No..Anand introduced me to her once.

1179
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,680
- Anand who?
- We are colleagues.

1180
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:17,550
Was he Prabha's friend?

1181
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,050
They were..

1182
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,260
Actually,
he's my friend but he liked her.

1183
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,390
I see..

1184
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:27,220
And Prabha?

1185
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,350
I don't know..

1186
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:35,390
He just told me that
they went on a date once.

1187
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,760
Did anything happen that night?

1188
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:41,510
How would I know, sir?

1189
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:44,260
All he said was that she's a virgin.

1190
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:45,300
Virgin!

1191
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:51,300
- Send Anand inside.
- Yes, sir.

1192
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,010
Anand..come inside.

1193
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:55,260
Yes sir.

1194
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,180
Yes sir.

1195
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,970
- Anand..
- Yes sir i'm coming.

1196
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:04,220
- Anand, they are calling you inside.
- I know.

1197
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:05,220
If anyone asks you..

1198
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,470
..then please don't tell anyone
that you gave me her address.

1199
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:08,680
Why not? I will tell them everything.

1200
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,220
What are you saying?
Why will you tell them that?

1201
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:11,890
Why shouldn't I?

1202
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:14,220
- Then I'll be in trouble
- It's good then.

1203
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,100
- Aren't we friends?
- I don't have a friend..

1204
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,850
Listen.. What are you saying?

1205
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:21,640
You should've thought
this before killing her.

1206
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,300
I swear I didn't do anything.

1207
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:26,600
Fine, I won't tell anyone.

1208
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,390
But I want Prabha's share now.

1209
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:32,350
- You want money?
- Yeah..

1210
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:34,180
- Aren't you my friend?
- I am no friend.

1211
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:35,550
Are you going to pay up or not?

1212
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:39,050
- Will you pay me or not?
- I will give you the money.

1213
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:39,970
Okay.

1214
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:41,800
I will give you the money.

1215
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,760
- Which car did you take on your date?
- My car of course.

1216
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:02,800
Where's the key?

1217
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:04,890
- There's the key, sir.
- Come on.

1218
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,800
- But why, sir..
- Give me the keys.

1219
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:07,930
- I haven't done anything..
- Hurry up.

1220
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,970
I said hurry up.

1221
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:19,550
Honestly sir,
we only went on one date.

1222
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,800
What can I do?
Nothing happened that day.

1223
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:22,220
- And the next day..
- Which is your car?

1224
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:23,220
This one.

1225
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:23,970
Open it.

1226
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,010
- Sir, there's nothing in the car.
- I said open it.

1227
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:28,850
- Check it.
- Yes sir.

1228
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:33,600
- Open the trunk.
- I don't keep anything..

1229
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,970
I said open the trunk.

1230
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,890
- Take a look.
- There's nothing in here, sir.

1231
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:40,180
Did you find anything?
See for yourself.

1232
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,050
You won't find anything.

1233
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,100
- Take him in.
- No, sir. That's not mine.

1234
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,350
- How dare you kill a virgin girl?
- No sir..

1235
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:30,260
Hello.

1236
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:32,640
Dev Kaushal.

1237
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,760
You are a busy man.

1238
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,510
Who?

1239
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,390
You don't know Chawla.

1240
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,050
But Chawla knows
everything about you.

1241
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:46,720
Chawla who? Manoj Chawla?

1242
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:48,680
Just Chawla.

1243
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,680
Yes tell me.

1244
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,550
Chawla wants to meet.

1245
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:54,890
Whom?

1246
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,850
You of course.

1247
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:58,300
But why?

1248
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,350
You're the Blackmailer.

1249
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:05,470
When and where that Chawla
will text you. Okay.

1250
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,890
Be there on time.

1251
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:08,890
You know time is money.

1252
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:31,550
So you're trying to say that
Dev is blackmailing his wife's lover.

1253
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,510
And he told you this.

1254
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,300
And you told Prabha.

1255
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,470
Then Prabha started blackmailing him.

1256
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:40,640
Yes, sir..

1257
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,850
..which is why he killed Prabha.

1258
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:50,720
This sounds like
a story of some B-grade film.

1259
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,970
You Virgin Killer.

1260
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,390
- I swear, I..
- Hey.

1261
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:56,470
Don't try to impress our sir
by talking in Marathi.

1262
01:32:57,390 --> 01:32:58,300
I swear, sir.

1263
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:00,890
The night Prabha was killed..

1264
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,390
..Dev asked me for her address.

1265
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,550
I gave it to him myself.

1266
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:13,680
What is the name of his wife's lover?

1267
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:16,430
He didn't tell me that.

1268
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,720
Move..

1269
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,140
Do you guys ever study?

1270
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,430
Why do always get beaten up?
Stop drinking.

1271
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:31,100
How are you?

1272
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:35,050
Go on.

1273
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:36,890
I said go.

1274
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,510
Have you decided which
one you want to buy?

1275
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,430
Which one will you recommend?

1276
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,890
"You must be really happy today."

1277
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,680
Glock 210..Austria.

1278
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:12,510
Mr. Bachchan used
it in the film 'Deewar'.

1279
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,260
200,000 only.

1280
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,680
What's your name Basanti?

1281
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:25,470
Sholay.

1282
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,550
The Colt 1851..American.

1283
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:32,510
Mr. Bachchan used this to kill Sambha.

1284
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,600
150,000 only.

1285
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,510
Honor. Tradition! Discipline.

1286
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,390
Are the three pillars of Gurukul!

1287
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,350
Makarov..Russian.

1288
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:47,390
Mohabbatein.

1289
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:49,350
Mohabbatein.

1290
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,390
But there was no gun in Mohabbatein.

1291
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:52,720
It was in the drawer, no one saw it.

1292
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,300
100,000 only.

1293
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:58,720
What the..

1294
01:34:58,930 --> 01:34:59,720
Here..

1295
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:02,760
Yadav Brothers, Amroha, India.

1296
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:04,470
A locally made Pistol.

1297
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,720
6,999..with 6 bullets free.

1298
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:10,970
- Used in the film Kaalia, by..
- Mr. Bachchan.

1299
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:14,300
- No.. Kaalia starring Mithun.
- Mithun?

1300
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:15,600
Its perfect for you.

1301
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:17,390
Is it working?

1302
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,220
You must aim 1.5 inches to the left..

1303
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:21,640
..and it will hit its mark.

1304
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:24,470
Little more.

1305
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:26,760
Good..that's better.

1306
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,100
The countdown has begun.

1307
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:35,930
The day after tomorrow,
when we launch our product..

1308
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,930
..Indians will enter
a new phase of evolution.

1309
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:41,760
I know you all have
worked very hard for this..

1310
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:46,890
..and, I don't want
you to lose your focus..

1311
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:50,010
Dev!

1312
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,390
Yes, sir.

1313
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:55,350
Dev..Dev, my friend.

1314
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:59,510
I know, Prabha being a virgin,
her murder..

1315
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,350
..and Anand being accused of it.

1316
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:03,050
It's just too much for you.

1317
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:04,890
I mean, I am shocked too.

1318
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:07,600
- Anand stole my wife's photo.
- Yes, sir.

1319
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,100
- Shameful.
- Yes, sir.

1320
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:12,220
But we can't get distracted right now.

1321
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:13,800
No, sir.

1322
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:16,550
- Especially you.
- Yes, sir.

1323
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,140
We need you.

1324
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:19,890
I need you!

1325
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:27,350
And..now for the good news.

1326
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:28,010
Pandey.

1327
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:31,510
Tomorrow, at exactly 22:00 hours..

1328
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:35,510
..the Municipality will turn
off the water supply in this area.

1329
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:39,510
All our distributors,
direct sales agents..

1330
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,930
..should be in every nook
and corner of this area.

1331
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:46,550
The day after tomorrow people
must go to the toilet with a..

1332
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,720
'My Handy' toilet paper,
instead of the newspaper.

1333
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,260
- Understand.
- Yes, sir.

1334
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:54,930
- I don't hear you.
- Yes, sir!

1335
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:55,890
Yes, sir!

1336
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:58,800
Okay..let's get back to work.

1337
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,050
Nice perfume.

1338
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,600
Who are you meeting?

1339
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,350
My business partner.

1340
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:24,760
What did you say his name was?

1341
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,100
Edward..

1342
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,470
Edward!

1343
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:39,800
But you said it's Dev.

1344
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:43,100
Exactly..

1345
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:44,850
Dev Edward.

1346
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:47,470
He's a mixed Catholic.

1347
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,800
There are like him.
Didn't I tell you?

1348
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:53,470
Well, Dolly, I am getting late.
See you.

1349
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:57,010
Bye, good day.

1350
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,890
Where were you the
night Prabha got murdered?

1351
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,930
Right here in the office.

1352
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,260
- Do you stay in the office very late?
- Yes.

1353
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,470
Yeah..

1354
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:16,220
When the wife's having an affair..

1355
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,970
..what's the point
in going home early?

1356
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:18,970
What?

1357
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,800
Your wife's having an affair,
isn't she?

1358
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,350
No.

1359
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,550
Says who?

1360
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:25,930
Forget it.

1361
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,260
But, aren't you blackmailing
your wife's lover?

1362
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:33,720
No..no, she doesn't have a lover.

1363
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,010
I see..

1364
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:38,680
So you didn't tell Anand anything?

1365
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:39,850
No.

1366
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,390
And Anand didn't tell
Prabha anything either?

1367
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:44,260
No.

1368
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,350
So Prabha was blackmailing you?

1369
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:47,140
No.

1370
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:48,890
Then why did you ask
for Prabha's address?

1371
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,010
That was because..

1372
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:52,010
- I was..
- You're trapped.

1373
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:55,140
You're trapped. Trapped..

1374
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:00,010
Well..I'll arrest
you in a couple of days.

1375
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,140
Don't try to run!

1376
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:05,760
Bye.

1377
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,510
Ranjit, where the hell were you?

1378
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:53,100
Give me your hand.

1379
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:55,550
Feel how firm it is.

1380
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,010
Why do you have a gun?

1381
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:02,470
To shoot the blackmailer.

1382
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:10,470
Have you lost your mind?

1383
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:12,800
Are you going to murder
him to hide our affair?

1384
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:14,550
Don't talk like my wife.

1385
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,930
I told you to hire a private detective
to find the blackmailer..

1386
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:19,180
..but you couldn't even do that.

1387
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:20,350
And you have a gun.

1388
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,350
Found him.

1389
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,470
Who?

1390
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,010
Private Detective.

1391
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:27,180
He's the one who got me this.

1392
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,970
- What?
- Gun, what else?

1393
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:31,390
Hey dude, will you let me watch the movie or not?

1394
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,300
Look ahead.

1395
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:37,930
Is he any good?

1396
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:39,850
Read the third line.

1397
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:44,260
- 97% success rate..
- 97% success rate!

1398
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,300
He said he'll do it.

1399
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:51,720
But, it will take some time.

1400
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:55,260
Time? And,
what do we do until then?

1401
01:40:56,180 --> 01:41:00,140
He said we should keep
paying the blackmailer for now.

1402
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:01,970
But how?

1403
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:03,800
I don't have any more money.

1404
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,260
Why don't you get it?

1405
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:08,680
I don't have any more money.
I can't ask Dev for more money.

1406
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,680
I am there.

1407
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:00,140
Why did you..

1408
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:04,550
I won't spare you.

1409
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:07,600
Where are you going?

1410
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,390
Have you lost your mind, Anand?

1411
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:11,800
That will hurt.

1412
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:14,140
I will break your head.

1413
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:16,640
I will break your legs.

1414
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:20,010
Dev!

1415
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:29,260
That will hurt. That will hurt.

1416
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,720
I'll tell Everyone. You're a murderer.

1417
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,470
- That will hurt.
- You're a murderer.

1418
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:38,720
I will tell Reena. You're a murderer.

1419
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:41,930
Now my turn.

1420
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:48,350
- Don't..
- You took my job, my reputation..

1421
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:49,510
Even the girl.

1422
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:50,930
You tricked me.

1423
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:55,470
I purposely tricked you.

1424
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:59,260
Do you know why?
Because I have a million dollar plan.

1425
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,970
No-no..

1426
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:04,140
First, you killed Prabha
and then you tricked me.

1427
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,260
Now you're tempting me with money.

1428
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:08,470
Are you tempted?

1429
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:10,600
Yes.

1430
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,010
Good-good..

1431
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:14,890
Now listen to me.
Throw that away.

1432
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:18,890
- No-no-no..
- Fine, I am throwing this away first.

1433
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:21,260
Throw it away.

1434
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:22,680
Throw it away.

1435
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,220
I didn't kill Prabha.

1436
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:32,720
But, I had to trick you..

1437
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,140
..otherwise I would've
been a suspect.

1438
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,100
And if they had doubted me
then we would've lost millions.

1439
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:42,600
And I knew that you will anyhow
get out of this.

1440
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:46,890
Now..let my plan be completed.

1441
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:49,640
What is the plan?

1442
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:52,390
It's in the making.

1443
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,970
You are trying to fool me.

1444
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,890
Honestly.

1445
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,050
I promise.

1446
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,140
Will I lie?

1447
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,720
Look, buddy,
if you try to trick me again..

1448
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,010
..I'll expose you completely.

1449
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,430
Smile properly.

1450
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:23,510
You've really grown up.
Where is your dad?

1451
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:25,720
Milind..she's really grown up now.

1452
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,140
No..
You take one.

1453
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,600
Whose wedding is it?

1454
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,350
He is Chawla's client's nephew.

1455
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:34,300
So what now?

1456
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:36,140
You say.

1457
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,140
No, you say.

1458
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:42,100
10..

1459
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:44,220
10,000

1460
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,600
Are you buying a washing machine?

1461
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:49,100
Chawla will need 50,000.

1462
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:53,140
50,000 is out of the question.
That's too much.

1463
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,890
- Do you have 100 rupees?
- What?

1464
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:56,100
100 rupees.

1465
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,260
- 100 rupees?
- Yes.

1466
01:44:58,470 --> 01:44:59,850
- Yes, I do.
- Give me.

1467
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:08,140
That makes it 101.

1468
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:11,510
An auspicious gift should
always consist of 101 Rs.

1469
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,930
Chawla knows everything.

1470
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:18,260
Chawla knows that Ranjit has decided.

1471
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:21,760
- Decided what?
- To kill you.

1472
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,680
Completely.

1473
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,220
Uncle, we're up next.

1474
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:28,260
Come on.

1475
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:30,930
You're looking really handsome, son.

1476
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,220
When he was small, he used to pee on me.

1477
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:34,050
Congratulations.

1478
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:34,970
Come on.

1479
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,550
He's family. Say hello to him.

1480
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

1481
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:39,720
I'll need some time.

1482
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:41,850
We'll discuss it later.
First, let's get a picture.

1483
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:42,550
Sir one photo please.

1484
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:43,600
Take a picture.

1485
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:46,600
Chawla has a big heart.

1486
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:48,100
You'll get 24 hours.

1487
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:50,550
Where is Chawla?

1488
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,510
Do you want to chop something, mam?

1489
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,760
I will do it.

1490
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:01,390
No..

1491
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,220
I will chop this one on my own.

1492
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:08,430
Go home..

1493
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:14,300
And, send Monu and
the security guard too.

1494
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,600
Yes, Mam.

1495
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,050
Listen..

1496
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:21,470
Turn the lights off.

1497
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,680
Malti.

1498
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,470
Monu.

1499

Monu..

1500

Dolly.

1501
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,680
Dolly, are you out of your mind?

1502
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:12,550
- Dolly leave me.
- I won't.

1503
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:15,260
I won't spare you.

1504
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:16,970
I'll kill you!

1505
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:24,010
I'll kill you!

1506
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,010
Dolly?

1507
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,300
Dolly?

1508
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,390

Hello.

1540

Bloody Chawla..

1541
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:02,220
..or Chawla's assistant,
or whoever you are.

was about to call you.

- No.

I still have three bullets left.

Hello..don't get angry like this..

Hello, mom. How are you?

1572
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:46,100
Son, we don't have any money.

1573
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:51,180
Reena told me, but you must have
something in case of an emergency.

1574
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:52,760
Don't do this, son.

1575
01:55:52,970 --> 01:55:54,890
We've only enough
to buy his medicines.

1576
01:55:55,510 --> 01:55:56,430
I see..

1577
01:55:57,010 --> 01:55:58,800
You were never so money-minded, Dev.

1578
01:55:58,890 --> 01:55:59,930
Have some pity on us.

1579
01:56:00,010 --> 01:56:02,470
No, mom, it's not what you think.
But..

1580
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,350
Fine, I'll try..

1581
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,470

1582
01:56:08,890 --> 01:56:10,100
Whose surgery?

1583
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:12,050
Dad's surgery...Dad

1584
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,300
But he doesn't have a surgery

1585
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:19,390
Then what about those expensive
tests you did last week?

1586
01:56:19,850 --> 01:56:21,760
That wasn't last week.

1596
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:49,100
Where are you?

1597
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:51,890

1603
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:25,850
She isn't answering her phone.

1604
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:27,430
But it's ringing.

1605
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:37,680

Yes tell me.

1609
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:46,220
Where are you, dude?
We were supposed to meet today.

1610
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:48,430
Listen-Listen-Listen..
are you at home tonight?

1611
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:50,390
Stay at home, I am coming over.

1612
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:53,640
- And, what about the plan?
- It's ready.

1613
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:57,760
Fine, come soon. I am waiting for you.

1614
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:02,470
50,000.

1615
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:04,470
Chawla will count.

1616
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,390
Why count? It's all there.

1617
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:07,970
Chawla will still count.

1618
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:11,430
I need a favor.

1619
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:30,970
- Has the detective given any information?
- No.

1620
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,260
If he doesn't give any
information by tonight..

1621
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:35,600
- ..I am calling the cops.
- No..not cops.

1622
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:44,970
- Yeah, Chawla.
- You're really lucky.

1623
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:48,390
Chawla has found the
name of your blackmailer.

1624
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:49,350
You found.

1625
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:51,850
Who is he?

1626
02:04:35,470 --> 02:04:39,640
"The world can't sc*** someone,
who's already screwing himself."

1627
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:44,180
who's already scr**** himself."

1628
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:51,260
"Without even having to try too hard."

1629
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:03,300
"O crazy heart better brace yourself."

1630
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:08,140
"You must know how
to pleasure yourself."

1631
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:12,180
"Don't think twice and,
just do-do-do it.."

1632
02:05:12,470 --> 02:05:14,760
"Just do this sin..!"

1633
02:05:17,470 --> 02:05:24,720
"Just do this sin..!"

1634
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:32,470
Who are you?

1635
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:33,760
I need a favor.

1636
02:05:35,890 --> 02:05:37,720
Call him up and give him a name.

1637
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:39,800
- Anand Tripathi?
- Yes.

1638
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:44,050
Sonia!

1639
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:32,720
Dolly.

1640
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:36,350
- Look there.
- No, she is not there.

1641
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:54,510
Dolly.

1642
02:07:55,930 --> 02:07:56,640
Dolly.

1643
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:57,930
Are you in there?

1644
02:07:59,140 --> 02:07:59,680
Dolly..

1645
02:08:01,050 --> 02:08:01,760
Mom.

1646
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:02,850
Blood?

1647
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:04,390
No-No-No, this isn't Dolly's.

1648
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:05,350
- Dolly.
- No..

1649
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:07,350
- He killed Dolly.
- No..no..

1650
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:10,100
- You killed her.
- No, I didn't do anything..

1651
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:12,350
He killed Dolly.

1652
02:08:13,470 --> 02:08:16,430
Please.. please.. listen to me.

1653
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:21,140
I didn't do it.

1654
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:22,970
Text: When are you coming home?

1655
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:51,680
"I swear I'm going to make you pay."

1656
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,720
"I loved you so much
but you never cared."

1657
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:57,760
"I know it tastes bitter
but it's the most effective."

1658
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:59,800
"We're no longer one soul."

1659
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:02,680
"No more running behind you I'm going
to get everything back you stole."

1660
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:04,640
"Love maybe lost and there's
just darkness in my heart."

1661
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:17,100
"Revenge."

1662
02:10:29,470 --> 02:10:30,600
"Revenge."

1663
02:10:48,050 --> 02:10:50,680
The sudden cut-off in the water supply
by the Municipal Corporation..

1664
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,220
..created a chaos amongst
citizens for a while.

1665
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:54,800
But the situation
is under control.

1666
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:58,350
As people opted to start their day
with Jet Mineral Water.

1667
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:01,470
- The sales of Jet Mineral Water has
shot up unexpectedly... - What?

1668
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:03,260
- No. - Experts consider this a brilliant
marketing strategy by jet mineral water.

1669
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:05,430
That's.. That's my strategy.

1670
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:09,300
Get off.

1671
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:13,470
How dare you?
