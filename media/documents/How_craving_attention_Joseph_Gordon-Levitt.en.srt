1
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:16,006
First of all, thank you
for your attention.

2
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:20,087
There's nothing quite like
being in a room full of people like this,

3
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:23,141
where all of you are giving
your attention to me.

4
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:27,087
It's a powerful feeling, to get attention.

5
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:33,367
I'm an actor, so I'm a bit
of an expert on, well, nothing, really.

6
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,542
(Laughter)

7
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,030
But I do know what it feels like
to get attention --

8
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,349
I've been lucky in my life

9
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,783
to get a lot more
than my fair share of attention.

10
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,506
And I'm grateful for that,

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,045
because like I said,
it's a powerful feeling.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,240
But there's another powerful feeling

13
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:52,629
that I've also been lucky
to experience a lot as an actor.

14
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,010
And it's funny, it's sort of
the opposite feeling,

15
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,525
because it doesn't come
from getting attention.

16
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:59,616
It comes from paying attention.

17
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:02,601
When I'm acting,

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:07,021
I get so focused that I'm only
paying attention to one thing.

19
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:10,355
Like when I'm on set
and we're about to shoot

20
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,029
and the first AD calls out "Rolling!"

21
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:15,434
And then I hear "speed," "marker," "set,"

22
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,029
and then the director calls "Action!"

23
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:20,057
I've heard that sequence so many times,

24
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:23,711
like, it's become this Pavlovian
magic spell for me.

25
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:27,353
"Rolling," "speed," "marker,"
"set" and "action."

26
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:30,131
Something happens to me,
I can't even help it.

27
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,152
My attention ...

28
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:34,548
narrows.

29
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:36,540
And everything else in the world,

30
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:42,336
anything else that might be bothering me
or might grab my attention,

31
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:46,697
it all goes away, and I'm just ... there.

32
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:52,553
And that feeling, that is what I love,

33
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:53,925
that, to me, is creativity.

34
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:57,434
And that's the biggest reason
I'm so grateful that I get to be an actor.

35
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:01,512
So, there's these two powerful feelings.

36
00:02:01,843 --> 00:02:05,487
There's getting attention
and paying attention.

37
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:07,915
Of course, in the last decade or so,

38
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,156
new technology has allowed
more and more people

39
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,870
to have this powerful feeling
of getting attention.

40
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,712
For any kind of creative
expression, not just acting.

41
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,326
It could be writing or photography
or drawing, music -- everything.

42
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,850
The channels of distribution
have been democratized,

43
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:25,474
and that's a good thing.

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,191
But I do think there's
an unintended consequence

45
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:35,326
for anybody on the planet
with an urge to be creative --

46
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,682
myself included,
because I'm not immune to this.

47
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,322
I think that our creativity

48
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:46,418
is becoming more and more
of a means to an end --

49
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:50,487
and that end is to get attention.

50
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,292
And so I feel compelled to speak up

51
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:56,045
because in my experience,

52
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,465
the more I go after that powerful
feeling of paying attention,

53
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,878
the happier I am.

54
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:06,727
But the more I go after
the powerful feeling of getting attention,

55
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,019
the unhappier I am.

56
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:09,488
(One person claps)

57
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:11,606
And -- thanks.

58
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,579
(Laughter)

59
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:18,233
(Applause)

60
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:21,236
So this is something
that goes way back for me.

61
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,268
I think the first time I can remember
using my acting to get attention,

62
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,624
I was eight years old at summer camp.

63
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,625
And I'd been going on auditions
for about a year by then,

64
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,950
and I'd been lucky to get some small parts

65
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,768
in TV shows and commercials,

66
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:40,639
and I bragged about it a lot,
that summer at camp.

67
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,918
And at first, it worked.

68
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:45,649
The other kids gave me
a bunch of extra attention,

69
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:48,147
because I had been on "Family Ties."

70
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,433
That's a picture of me on "Family Ties."

71
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:51,480
(Laughter)

72
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:52,965
Then, the tide turned --

73
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,061
I think I took it too far
with the bragging.

74
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:58,573
And then, the other kids
started to make fun of me.

75
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:04,493
I remember there was this one girl
I had a crush on, Rocky.

76
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,612
Her name was Rachel, she went by Rocky.

77
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,686
And she was beautiful, and she could sing,

78
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:12,974
and I was smitten with her,
and I was standing there, bragging.

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,322
And she turned to me
and she called me a show-off.

80
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,574
Which I 100 percent deserved.

81
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,482
But you know, it still really hurt.

82
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:24,167
And ever since that summer,

83
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,768
I've had a certain hesitance
to seek attention for my acting.

84
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:31,281
Sometimes, people would ask me,

85
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,559
"Wait a minute,
if you don't like the attention,

86
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,876
then why are you an actor?"

87
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,073
And I'd be like,

88
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:39,272
"Because that's not what acting's about,
man, it's about the art."

89
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:40,982
And they'd be like, "OK, OK, dude."

90
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:43,013
(Laughter)

91
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:44,771
And then Twitter came out.

92
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,800
And I got totally hooked on it,
just like everybody else,

93
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,768
which made me into a complete hypocrite.

94
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:50,967
Because at that point,

95
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,570
I was absolutely using my acting
to get attention.

96
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,942
I mean, what, did I think
I was just getting all these followers

97
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,215
because of my brilliant tweets?

98
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,680
I actually did think that -- I was like --

99
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:02,712
(Laughter)

100
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,481
"They don't just like me
because they saw me in 'Batman,'

101
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,275
they like what I have to say,
I've got a way with words."

102
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,957
(Laughter)

103
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,283
And then in no time at all,

104
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:15,536
it started having an impact
on my dearly beloved creative process.

105
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:17,677
It still does.

106
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,233
I try not to let it.

107
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:22,843
But you know, I'd be sitting there,
like, reading a script.

108
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,121
And instead of thinking,

109
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:27,622
"How can I personally identify
with this character?"

110
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:30,567
Or "How is the audience
going to relate to this story?"

111
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:33,860
I'm like, "What are people going to say
about this movie on Twitter?"

112
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:35,152
And "What will I say back

113
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:38,116
that will be good and snarky enough
to get a lot of retweets,

114
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:39,303
but not too harsh,

115
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:42,723
because people love to get offended,
and I don't want to get canceled?"

116
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:44,756
These are the thoughts that enter my mind

117
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,842
when I'm supposed to be reading a script,
trying to be an artist.

118
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,284
And I'm not here to tell you

119
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,677
that technology
is the enemy of creativity.

120
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,868
I don't think that.

121
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:54,256
I think tech is just a tool.

122
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,203
It has the potential to foster
unprecedented human creativity.

123
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:01,843
Like, I even started
an online community called HITRECORD,

124
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,387
where people all over the world

125
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,565
collaborate on all kinds
of creative projects,

126
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:10,801
so I don't think that social media
or smartphones or any technology

127
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,711
is problematic in and of itself.

128
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,770
But ...

129
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:19,385
if we're going to talk
about the perils of creativity

130
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,727
becoming a means to get attention,

131
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:26,092
then we have to talk about
the attention-driven business model

132
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:28,229
of today's big social media
companies, right?

133
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:31,324
(Applause)

134
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,593
This will be familiar territory
for some of you,

135
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,602
but it's a really relevant question here:

136
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,219
How does a social media platform

137
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:39,844
like, for example, Instagram, make money?

138
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,739
It's not selling
a photo-sharing service --

139
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:43,936
that part's free.

140
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,135
So what is it selling?

141
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,317
It's selling attention.

142
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,965
It's selling the attention
of its users to advertisers.

143
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,941
And there's a lot of discussion right now

144
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:54,682
about how much attention we're all giving
to things like Instagram,

145
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,950
but my question is:

146
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:58,628
How is Instagram getting
so much attention?

147
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,201
We get it for them.

148
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:05,077
Anytime somebody posts on Instagram,

149
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:07,919
they get a certain amount of attention
from their followers,

150
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:10,806
whether they have a few followers
or a few million followers.

151
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,903
And the more attention you're able to get,

152
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,716
the more attention
Instagram is able to sell.

153
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,041
So it's in Instagram's interest

154
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,553
for you to get as much
attention as possible.

155
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:25,657
And so it trains you
to want that attention,

156
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:29,202
to crave it, to feel stressed out
when you're not getting enough of it.

157
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:33,981
Instagram gets its users addicted

158
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:36,718
to the powerful feeling
of getting attention.

159
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:41,475
And I know we all joke, like,
"Oh my God, I'm so addicted to my phone,"

160
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,268
but this is a real addiction.

161
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,758
There's a whole science to it.

162
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:47,481
If you're curious, I recommend
the work of Jaron Lanier,

163
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:50,013
Tristan Harris, Nir Eyal.

164
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,185
But here's what I can tell you.

165
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:55,442
Being addicted to getting attention

166
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:58,004
is just like being addicted
to anything else.

167
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,228
It's never enough.

168
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,584
You start out and you're thinking,

169
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:05,681
"If only I had 1,000 followers,
that would feel amazing."

170
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:09,085
But then you're like, "Well,
once I get to 10,000 followers,"

171
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:11,395
and, "Once I get to 100 --

172
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,500
Once I get to a million followers,
then I'll feel amazing."

173
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,412
So I have 4.2 million
followers on Twitter --

174
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,340
it's never made me feel amazing.

175
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,977
I'm not going to tell you
how many I have on Instagram,

176
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,289
because I feel genuine shame
about how low the number is,

177
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:32,282
because I joined Instagram
after "Batman" came out.

178
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:35,774
(Laughter)

179
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,039
And I search other actors,

180
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,323
and I see that their number
is higher than mine,

181
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:42,108
and it makes me feel
terrible about myself.

182
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,601
Because the follower count

183
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,022
makes everybody feel terrible
about themselves.

184
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:50,164
That feeling of inadequacy
is what drives you to post,

185
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,712
so you can get more attention,

186
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,861
and then that attention that you get
is what these companies sell,

187
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,713
that's how they make their money.

188
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:01,678
So there is no amount
of attention you can get

189
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:03,978
where you feel like you've arrived,

190
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,819
and you're like, "Ah, I'm good now."

191
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:11,714
And of course, there are a lot of actors
who are more famous than I am,

192
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,229
have more followers than I do,

193
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,601
but I bet you they would tell you
the same thing.

194
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:20,553
If your creativity is driven
by a desire to get attention,

195
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:23,228
you're never going to be
creatively fulfilled.

196
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:27,655
But I do have some good news.

197
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:31,464
There is this other powerful feeling.

198
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,449
Something else you can do
with your attention

199
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,433
besides letting a giant tech company
control it and sell it.

200
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,307
This is that feeling I was talking about,

201
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,718
why I love acting so much --

202
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:45,632
it's being able to pay attention
to just one thing.

203
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:50,036
Turns out there's actually
some science behind this too.

204
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,171
Psychologists and neuroscientists --

205
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:54,615
they study a phenomenon they call flow,

206
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,044
which is this thing that happens
in the human brain

207
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:59,226
when someone pays attention
to just one thing,

208
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,760
like something creative,

209
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:04,196
and manages not to get distracted
by anything else.

210
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,891
And some say the more regularly
you do this, the happier you'll be.

211
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:13,530
Now I'm not a psychologist
or a neuroscientist.

212
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:16,687
But I can tell you,
for me, that is very true.

213
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:19,569
It's not always easy, it's hard.

214
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:22,290
To really pay attention
like this takes practice,

215
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:23,879
everybody does it their own way.

216
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,796
But if there's one thing I can share

217
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,272
that I think helps me focus
and really pay attention, it's this:

218
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,660
I try not to see other creative
people as my competitors.

219
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,199
I try to find collaborators.

220
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:40,803
Like, if I'm acting in a scene,

221
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:43,970
if I start seeing the other actors
as my competitors, and I'm like,

222
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:46,463
"God, they're going to get
more attention than I am,

223
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,944
people are going to be talking
about their performance more than mine" --

224
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:51,136
I've lost my focus.

225
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,449
And I'm probably
going to suck in that scene.

226
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:57,379
But when I see the other actors
as collaborators,

227
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:01,153
then it becomes almost easy to focus,

228
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,640
because I'm just paying attention to them.

229
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,939
And I don't have to think
about what I'm doing --

230
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,406
I react to what they're doing,

231
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,846
they react to what I'm doing,

232
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,498
and we can kind of
keep each other in it together.

233
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:15,166
But I don't want you to think
it's only actors on a set

234
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,802
that can collaborate in this way.

235
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:19,232
I could be in whatever
kind of creative situation.

236
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,954
It could be professional,
could be just for fun.

237
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:26,501
I could be collaborating with people
I'm not even in the same room with.

238
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,997
In fact, some of my favorite
things I've ever made,

239
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,291
I made with people
that I never physically met.

240
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,482
And by the way,

241
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:35,463
this, to me, is the beauty
of the internet.

242
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,641
If we could just stop
competing for attention,

243
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:42,223
then the internet becomes
a great place to find collaborators.

244
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:48,036
And once I'm collaborating
with other people,

245
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:50,629
whether they're on set,
or online, wherever,

246
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:54,902
that makes it so much easier
for me to find that flow,

247
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,299
because we're all just paying attention

248
00:11:57,323 --> 00:12:00,079
to the one thing
that we're making together.

249
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:03,783
And I fell like I'm part
of something larger than myself,

250
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,076
and we all sort of shield each other

251
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,442
from anything else that might
otherwise grab our attention,

252
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:13,940
and we can all just be there.

253
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,030
At least that's what works for me.

254
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:20,771
Sometimes.

255
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:22,521
Sometimes -- it doesn't always work.

256
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:25,664
Sometimes, I still totally get
wrapped up in that addictive cycle

257
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:27,093
of wanting to get attention.

258
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:29,021
I mean, like, even right now,

259
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:33,050
can I honestly say there's not
some part of me here who's like,

260
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:35,923
"Hey, everybody, look at me,
I'm giving a TED Talk!"

261
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:37,193
(Laughter)

262
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:40,132
There is -- there's, you know, some part.

263
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,446
But I can also honestly say

264
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,895
that this whole creative process
of writing and giving this talk,

265
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,533
it's been a huge opportunity
for me to focus

266
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:51,643
and really pay attention to something
I care a lot about.

267
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:58,397
So regardless of how much attention
I do or don't get as a result,

268
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,688
I'm happy I did it.

269
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:04,096
And I'm grateful to all of you
for letting me.

270
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,611
So thank you, that's it,

271
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,896
you can give your attention
to someone else now.

272
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,071
Thanks again.

273
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,976
(Applause)
