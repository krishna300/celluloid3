00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,649
It's a party... enjoy yourself

I'll just he hack.

6
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,660
It's a Wedding not a seminar.

7
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,228
Come on, enjoy yourself!

8
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,524
I'll just he hack.

9
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,061
Don't feel shy my dear...

Loosen up and enjoy yourself.

Take it.

13
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,988
- Let's enjoy?
- Sorry...

14
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,992
- I have my chums.
- Excuse me?

15
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,693
Chums? Periods?

16
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,120
Menstrual cycle?

17
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,399
No problem! Stay free!

18
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,229
Enjoy "Y!

19
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,009
<i>Mrs. Aurora. Axon...</i>

20
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,344
I hope you ale happy with
the wedding arrangements.

21
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,780
Please don't say that...

22
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,040
Can't you see how much
everyone is enjoying?

23
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,346
Forget about everyone...

24
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,614
Look how happy 0111 son is!

25
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,749
You: daughter is lovely.

26
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,686
She will take good care of him.

27
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,659
MI. Kapoor, it's true...

28
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,562
behind every successful

29
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,757
there has to be a woman.

30
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,092
The two of us are
living proof of that!

31
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,061
Today he is VP, tomorrow
he will be President...

32
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,698
then CEO, Chairman.

33
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,801
How can a man work fol
16-1101115 a day...

34
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,980
without a good support system?

35
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,381
My daughter-in-law will
5011 out this fool's life.

36
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,680

37
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,985
<i>Hey Kia.

39
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,751
Hello? Hello?

40
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,125
Hello?

41
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,526
How can I enjoy myself?

42
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,291
My best friend is dying!

43
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,095
Today her happiness, dreams,
identity, independence...

44
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,692
Basically it's her last day
of being alive.

45
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,567
From tomorrow she will
be a support...

46
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,128
Like a pillar...

47
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,298
Ya, ya pillar.

48
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,400
Sure, that's important too.

49
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,240
But the world will always say...

50
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,176
Wow! What a building!

51
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,178
Who talks about the poor pillar'?

52
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,216
No, no I like marriage.

53
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,013
It's a nice concept.

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,543
But Why should I spend my
life with someone

55
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,749
who after 40 years will look
into my eyes and say...

56
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,022
Thank you fol being my pillar!

57
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,000
Enjoy, enjoy.

58
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,546
You ok?

59
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,479
Sorry!

60
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,454
Sorry!

61
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,760
You Want something?

62
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,133
Ma!

63
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,594
I Want my mom!

64
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,998
<i>Yes Minn'!?</i>

65
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,712
Can you get this gentleman...

66
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,175
- his Ma?
- Excuse me?

67
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,615
Mom?

68
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,165
Kabir.

69
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,068
<i>Kia.</i>

70
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,179
Mom...

71
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,341
would hold my hand really tight
during take off & landing...

72
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,344
Like this...

73
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,780
She was very scared of flying.

74
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,056
Was?

75
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,021
It's been 10 years
since she passed away.

76
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,188
Today is her birthday...

77
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,663
That's Why...

78
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,395
something happened,
something flashed,

79
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,497
something crashed...
and you received this gift.

80
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,008
What gift?

81
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,706
The gift of seeing a boy cry
live in flout of a gill.

82
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,314
You're happy light... -

83
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,287
that your mom was horn?

84
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,422
Then why cry on her birthday'?

85
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,590
Celebrate!

86
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,625
Happy birthday Aunty!

87
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,634
Dad's alive right?

88
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,503
Ya.

89
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,137
Are you sad that he is'?

90
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,043
No... he's OK.

91
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,444
Mama's boy!

92
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,685
Mama's boy does not
like his Daddy?

93
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,978
It's not that.
It's tough...

94
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,689
to like MI. Bhansal is tough.

95
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,158
My dad is Kumar Bansal

96
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,257
Bansal?

97
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,561
The builder'?

98
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,329
I'm already liking you!

99
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,069
You're the son of the man
who owns half of Delhi!

100
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,506
The most expensive scotch!

101
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,233
Double, on the locks
please!

102
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,636
This is the problem with
low cost airlines.

103
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,214
You can't tell the rich
from the poor.

104
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,978
Everyone travels economy.

105
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,616
So'?
MI. Kabir Bansal...

106
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,521
You were in Chandigarh
to buy Chandigarh'?

107
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,558
No.
My friend had a break-up...

108
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,218
I was there for rnoral support.

109
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,029
Cheers!

110
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,064
To you: friend's freedom.

111
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,227
So...

112
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,238
Having issues with dad?

113
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,073
You Want to transform his
business with your new ideas...

114
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,044
but he's not agreeing.
Corn-wt?

115
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,009
He Wants to show you
he's still the boss.

116
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,249
The usual problem with
big business families.

117
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,111
First produce a son
to takeover the business.

118
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,489
When the son is ready
to takeover,

119
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,388
the father is not ready
to handover!

120
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,222
The usual "father-son" friction

121
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,784
I totally get it

122
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,223
I have no interest in
my dad's business.

123
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,631
What?

124
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,624
And before you order another
double on the rocks...

125
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,603
I Want to share a big
truth with you.

126
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,572
What?

127
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,170
This expensive scotch
of yours...

128
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,140
I can't afford it.

129
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,382
Are you Kumar Bausal's stepson?

130
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,453
No, the one & only son.

131
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,313
But if I have no interest in
dad's business,

132
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,790
to have interest in
his money...

133
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,622
not cool, right?

134
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,456
So What do you do than?

135
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,087
Why?
Do I have to do something?

136
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,826
Yes of course!
Why do you need to do anything?

137
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,370
Whether you are interested
in dad's money...

138
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,335
or not...

139
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,702
<i>after he's gone R's
all yams anyway.</i>

140
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,174
- What do you do?
- I work at Marion.

141
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,466
What do you do there'?

142
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,704
I'm a Marketing Manager.

143
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,679
What plans after that?

144
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,044
After that, in a couple of years
I'll be Vice President.

145
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,477
After that?

146
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,746
I will he CEO.

147
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,744
WOW!

148
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,017
With such clarity...

149
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,548
every dream comes true.

150
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,050
- We should have a dream in life.
- Correct!

151
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,661
OI of coulee...

152
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,158
a dad!

153
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,061
Yes, I have a dad.

154
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,729
But even I have a dream.

155
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,434
- Don't tell me!
- Okay I Won't tell you.

156
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,239
Okay tell!

157
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,071
Because actually I really
want to know...

158
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,041
When someone has everything...

159
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,077
What would his dream he?

160
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,480
Tell...

161
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,485
I Want to he like my mom.

162
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,183
Excuse me?

163
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,458
I...

164
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,586
want to be like my mother.

165
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,024
My Plume!

166
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,229
When-is my phone?

167
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,461
Give me your number.

168
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,352
I just called to say
I am not a "She", I am a "He".

169
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,159
What?

170
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,095
I'm not gay.
I don't Want to change my sex...

171
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,029
I hate pink...

172
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,193
I like Women.
I like Whiskey.

173
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:42,365
You hid my phone so
you could get my number, right?

174
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,499
Cheap whiskey tomorrow night'?

175
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,270
Can I he honest?

176
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,476
I did find you a hit Weird.

177
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,483
So why did you come to
meet a weirdo'?

178
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,212
Just like the hook at the
end of a TV episode...

179
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,250
which compels you to Watch
the next episode

180
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,657
0111 meeting also ended
somewhat like that

181
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,354
"I Want to he like my mom!"

182
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,456
And than? And than?
And than? And than?

183
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,724
So just curiosity.

184
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,626
If it's not a problem
to he like your dad,

185
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,101
then What's the problem
with being like your mom?

186
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,433
They both produced Inc...

187
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,030
Haven't ever heard a man say...

188
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,242
that he Wants to he like
his Mommy.

189
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,709
Didn't Rajiv become like
Indira Gandhi'?

190
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,736
Doesn't Rahul Want to
he like Sonia?

191
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,505
Who was your mom?

192
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,547
Which country was she
the PM of!

193
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,719
She was an artist...

194
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,346
Was she a singer, dancer,
sculptor...

195
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,751
Housewife.

196
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,051
- What?
- She was a housewife.

197
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,054
And than? And than?
And than? And than?

198
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,296
Today's episode...

199
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,359
same time, same place?

200
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,140
The shock has given me
severe acidity...

201
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,436
Can't drink tonight.

202
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,175
<i>Ma' am.</i>

203
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,544
What's this?

204
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,104
Dont know.
Came by courier.

205
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,012
Dig one'?

206
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,453
Gelusil?

207
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,041
It's not the alcohol...

208
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,246
it's the curiosity that's
causing the acidity.

209
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,248
Housewives are the
world's greatest artists.

210
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,218
- What's there to be curious'?
- It's not that...

211
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,513
I'm just curious to know
why an INM(B) topper,

212
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,558
instead of taking his
dad's business forward...

213
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,220
dreams to he a housewife
like his mom?

214
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,059
How do you know I'm
from INM(B)'?

215
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,224
Facebook.
It's a small world you know.

216
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,565
But my Facebook page hasn't
been active for ages.

217
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,704
I saw you: picture on a
Facebook friend's page.

218
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,602
Who?

219
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,368
- Neha.
- Dhupia?

220
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,768
Dholakia.

221
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,643
Forget about yesterday...

222
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,544
Yesterday is old news...

223
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,313
I didn't see any
suggestive pictures.

224
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,082
It was tagged,
"Me and my genius topper friend".

225
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,522
So I assumed you guys
were batch mates.

226
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,347
But now I'm 011110115...

227
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,089
Before more curiousity
gives you more acidity...

228
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,120
Eat!

229
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,395
How do you know I
like this pasta?

230
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,203
You: tresses, long and
thick like spaghetti...

231
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,640
Eyes, black like olives...

232
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,043
actually,
eyes not so black...

233
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,415
Nose pointed like
baby corn.

234
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,385
Cheeks flushed like
cherry tomatoes.

235
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,287
Lips made of sliced
bell pepper.

236
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,114
A spicy tongue like
jalapeo.

237
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,327
You are a full on pasta dish.

238
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,351
You're not going to eat
stuffed Indian bread.

239
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,221
Wow Kabir!

240
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,164
I'm floored.

241
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,034
No one has ever seen me
as a vegetable shop!

242
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,199
So romantic.

243
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,108
How can anyone be
romantic with you'?

244
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,199
You Want to arrive fast...

245
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,041
eat fast, talk fast, listen fast...

246
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,375
move ahead fast...

247
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,109
Romance...

248
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,015
happens in slow motion.

249
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,993
Now did you feel something?

250
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,020
Neha...

251
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,627
<i>But somethings fishy.</i>

252
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,033
The pasta's veg,
how can it be fishy'?

253
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,538
If you didn't Want to
he in business,

254
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,732
Why do an MBA?

255
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,337
Before being against something...

256
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,307
one should understand
it fully.

257
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,434
Why are you so
against business?

258
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,311
What is business?
A man has a dream...

259
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,448
To fulfill it he starts
a company.

260
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,448
He employs people to
run the company...

261
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,044
and gives them all a dream
of "moving ahead".

262
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,023
Working day and night,
"moving ahead",

263
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,048
earning millions,
they become blind...

264
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,755
and can't even see that their dreams
Were fulfilled long ago.

265
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,492
Instead of enjoying the
fruits of their labour,

266
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,056
they keep "moving ahead"
like zombies!

267
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,293
Acidity, stress,
heart problems...

268
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,701
Finally they end up in an expensive
private hospital and say...

269
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:15,070
"Thank God! I can afford
World-class medical treatment."

270
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,148
What? I'm serious!

271
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,151
This mantra of moving ahead
is the most dangerous.

272
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,751
Who are you moving
ahead of!

273
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,421
Where are you going'?
Why are you going'?

274
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,320
In the housewife sector,
there's no "moving ahead" madness.

275
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,323
There's no ranking in
this industry.

276
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,420
So no insecurity,
no acidity

277
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,427
only happiness.

278
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,228
Oh great Saint Kabir.

279
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,195
You're full of shit.

280
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,732
Your goal is to avoid
hard work all your life

281
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,303
I've never heard such a rubbish
philosophy in my life.

282
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,411
Why?

283
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,438
If someone like your dad
does not dream of "moving ahead"...

284
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,583
then how do you become a housewife
and sit at home like your mom?

285
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,679
Mom didn't sit at home

286
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,653
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

287
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,253
How did you mean it than?

288
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,063
What did you mean?

289
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,199
Without a visiting card
or designation...

290
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,066
a person has no value?

291
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,468
Is making a home lesser
than any profession?

292
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,140
It's the biggest bloody
art in the World...

293
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,699
The art of having
no dreams fol yourself.

294
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,273
The art of being happy for others.

295
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,007
The art of happily
sacrificing your identity.

296
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,316
Do you know What is
Mrs.. Bansal's actual name?

297
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,380
She was a pillar for my
big builder dad.

298
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,316
A building falls without support.

299
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,118
Just because she was not
famous or making millions...

300
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,590
she "sat at home and did nothing"?

301
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,755
She was creating a home.

302
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,586
My mother was an artist...

303
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,062
A great artist.

304
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,622
And like every great artist...

305
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,223
she was also very sensitive.

306
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,102
She died early because...

307
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,729
just like you, one day my
father told her...

308
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,303
"What do you do except sit at home!"

309
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,638
My goal is not to
avoid hard work.

310
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,011
But I work hard to avoid
useless goals.

311
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,291
Hey I'm sorry...

312
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,658
I'm really sorry.

313
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,498
I didn't mean it like that.

314
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,495
Hello?

315
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,560
Sorry man!
What do you Want me to do?

316
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,340
Come on now Kabir.

317
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,969
Aren't you a topper?
Please forgive lesser mortals.

318
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,302
Enough Kabir.

319
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,483
Even you: morn wouldn't approve of
such behaviour towards a gill

320
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,134
Sunday tomorrow.
What are you doing'?

321
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,524
I have work in office.

322
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,005
- Take the day off.
- It's tough.

323
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,298
Means you're not sorry.

324
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,733
Hey, this is so cool!

325
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,636
Shit man!

326
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,339
This is the solution to
global Warming!

327
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,143
Why do people buy cats?

328
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,645
Actually maybe fol Women
not so good.

329
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,279
Then-is a lot you don't know.

330
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,283
Yes... Can't tell from that beard
that you're a kid!

331
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,522
Your (one does not sound
like you are sorry.

332
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,156
No, no...

333
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,030
There's a child in everyone,
so it's cool.

334
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,328
You don't Want to go on
the toy train?

335
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,434
It's for ages under 12.

336
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,667
I love trains.

337
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,642
Vintage steam engines,
mini locomotives.

338
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,379
Many late models are here.

339
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,776
Even I have... a full train set!

340
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,512
The world is into space travel.

341
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,351
And you're stuck in
steam engines'?

342
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,749
The romance of trains...

343
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,793
You Won't get it.

344
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,288
You're a robot!
Corporate robot.

345
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,257
Your hardware has no
soft feelings.

346
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,531
You're a corporate psychopath.

347
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,036
If it were up to you,
you'd kill all office-goers.

348
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,530
There is softness.

349
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,707
Touch and see.

350
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,344
Just stone.

351
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,507
Did your mom and dad
feed you granite?

352
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,151
Not mom & dad.

353
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,744
Just mom

354
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,512
I was Z when I lost my dad
in an accident.

355
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,419
He died very young.

356
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,149
So only mom after that.

357
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,760
She married fast,
had a baby fast

358
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,257
became single fast.

359
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,062
So now you know Why
I am "fist-fast".

360
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,157
Hereditary problem

361
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,366
I'm so sorry.

362
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,131
Happens.

363
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,738
After dad died mom
made herself busy.

364
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,141
She became the queen
of social work.

365
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,376
Today she runs a few NGOs

366
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,181
I've always missed having a home

367
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,483
and a perfect family.

368
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,484
I had some softness too...

369
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,560
But now this is me.

370
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,692
Are you single?

371
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,293
Why, do I look double to you?

372
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,531
Don't you have a boyfriend?

373
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,730
On and off...

374
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,199
But no one permanent.

375
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,434
- You scare them away?
- Boys are chicken.

376
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,000
They can't handle a woman
more ambitious than them.

377
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,410
So you're going
to die single?

378
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,176
In an expensive hospital.

379
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,548
But Why are you so curious?

380
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,583
Why? Do you hold the
copyright to he curious?

381
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,450
OK ask me.

382
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,385
- When is you: birthday'?
- 15th April.

383
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,626
What are you saying?
Mine too! 15th April!!

384
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,663
- What'? Don't lie.
- Here look, my I.D.

385
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,356
You think we are twins
separated at birth?

386
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,657
1988!

387
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,361
And you?

388
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,133
Where are you: manners'?

389
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,766
Never ask a woman her
year of birth!

390
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,772
Did you see the 1983 World Cup,
when India won'?

391
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,774
No. I Wasn't horn then.

392
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,042
And the 1987 World Cup'?
When Australia won'?

393
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,714
- No. I was too young.
- That means you are '84 horn

394
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,691
- '85
- You said it, I didn't ask!

395
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,025
Do you like kids?

396
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,029
Yes. But other's.

397
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,497
Don't kids slit your
maternal instincts?

398
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,696
There are so many
kids around.

399
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,603
Why produce one more'?

400
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,140
Afraid'?

401
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,743
Kids and marriage will hijack
your flight to success?

402
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,046
The idea of marriage is good.

403
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,749
It's nice to have someone.

404
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,646
To talk to...

405
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,517
like a special friend...

406
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,613
who you can
cuddle and sleep with!

407
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,115
Your own private happy space.

408
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,458
But a Woman pays too heavy
a price in marriage.

409
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,032
No offense to you: morn, but
the responsibility of a happy home,

410
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,724
is always forced
onto the woman.

411
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,634
However evolved a man is...

412
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,266
a woman's career somewhere
gets compromised.

413
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,635
Marriage is not fol me.

414
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,371
Why? So many Women
manage both Well.

415
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,537
They're super, super women.

416
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,016
So aren't you a super, super,
super woman?

417
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,217
Not at all.

418
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,116
So marry me then!

419
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,619
If you Want to slap me,
then on this cheek please...

420
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,255
I have dental problems this side.

421
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,229
The doctor said I have to
extract my wisdom tooth.

422
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,235
"You're too wise!"

423
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,605
Now Who's fist-fast?

424
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,542
Slow down!

425
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,737
Why should I he the scapegoat
fol you to he a housewife?

426
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,605
Scapegoat?

427
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,214
You Want to move ahead fast,
I don't Want to move ahead at all.

428
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,781
You Want marriage but
you don't Want the domestic hassles

429
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,253
I Want marriage too...

430
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,425
but don't want the office,
career, ambition hassles.

431
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,258
Even out birthdays are the same.

432
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,760
OK I'm three years younger,
but big deal!

433
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,263
We are 100% made for each other.

434
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,669
Unless of coulee you're chicken...

435
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,098
And can't handle
a man without ambition

436
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,614
I'm not in love with you.

437
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,312
Neither am I.

438
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,453
If you're not in love then
why do you want to marry'?

439
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,715
We should get married first...

440
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,116
If we fall in love before...
what will we do after marriage'?

441
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,328
You're breathing is heavy...

442
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,588
You're breaking into a sweat...

443
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,198
You're body is trembling...

444
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,368
You're not in love'?

445
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,733
With my one touch...

446
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,502
your heart was pounding...

447
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,544
You couldn't speak a Wold...

448
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,511
Skipped work to hang
with an aimless dude and...

449
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,416
eat greasy food...

450
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,316
You're not in love'?

451
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,465
Foolish love... Foolish love.

452
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,567
<i>This love of mus.</i>

453
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,605
Foolish love... Foolish love.

454
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,005
All topsy-turvy... -

455
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,386
Is there a dog in the house?

456
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,286
Sorry about the mess!

457
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,190
- Hi.
- Hi!

458
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,396
Mom, Kabir
Kabir, mom.

459
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,563
Hi Kabir.

460
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,139
You are her mom?

461
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,701
Are you married?

462
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,102
Say the wold We can change
plans and slope right away!

463
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,739
You only hit on women
older than you'?

464
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,242
Excuse me?

465
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,681
Where are the older women'?

466
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,011
How old are you mister?

467
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,687
Mom We share the same birthday.

468
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,288
But he's 1988.

469
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,721
So he's hitting on you.

470
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,655
No lines. Full circle.

471
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,193
Crazy guy Wants to marry me!

472
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,491
Kabir!

473
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,694
Why do you Want to
commit suicide?

474
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,001
Be single, he happy...

475
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,271
Do something with your life.

476
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,702
Life is too short.

477
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,103
Why Waste it being
someone's husband?

478
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,408
Actually mom, not husband...

479
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,014
he Wants to he my Wife.

480
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,275
What?

481
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,425
Interesting...

482
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,989
Meaning you will eat fol flee?

483
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,136
You Women think like men...

484
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,431
and then call us chauvinists!

485
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,134
If Kia was your son...

486
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,402
and brought home a gill

487
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,610
who Wants to marry and
he a housewife...

488
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,270
Would you ask that gill the
same question?

489
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,045
Point!

490
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,039
But I would ask the
same question even then.

491
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,155
My daughter truly loves you.

492
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,555
Wow mom!

493
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,561
- You're Sherlock Holmes.
- You're not getting it!

494
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,429
What I mean is,
when Women fall in love...

495
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,457
foolish men think We
love only them.

496
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,365
But we love them,
their job, their position...

497
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:32,168
financial security...
We love the Whole package deal.

498
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,243
But there is nothing to love
ab out you...

499
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,075
except yourself!

500
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,771
You Won't even take
your dad's money.

501
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,148
Which means she really
loves you for you.

502
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,275
Which means...

503
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,385
there must be surely something
special about you.

504
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,683
Oh, your's praising me!

505
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,549
For a second,
I was confused!

506
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,687
But you're OK with this or
not OK with this?

507
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,395
Had sex?

508
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,062
Important before commitment

509
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,431
I'm very excited!

510
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,765
Kia April 15th
Kabir April 15th.

511
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,442
Kia Weds Kabir, also April 15th?

512
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,535
Titanic sank April 15th.

513
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,307
You will never forget the date!

514
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,408
Dad, Kia
Kia, dad.

515
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,550
Sit it's an honour meeting you.

516
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,418
The honour is all mine.

517
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,319
It is the first time he is
introducing me to a friend.

518
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,150
Please sit.
What will you drink?

519
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,357
No, nothing.
I'm fine, thank you.

520
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,564
We are getting married.

521
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,140
What do you do my dear?

522
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,668
- I work at Marion...
- Drivel, peon...

523
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,179
liftman, Watchman...
Anything!

524
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,614
First get him a job...

525
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,481
then do whatever you
Want with him.

526
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,584
How will he look after you?

527
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,486
Just like mom did.

528
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,547
Have you gone mad?
You'll live off a Woman?

529
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,191
You are a man!

530
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,228
If you've forgotten go in, take off
you: underwear and check!

531
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,099
If you don't want to do anything
with you: life then die alone

532
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,124
I'm dealing with it...

533
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,634
It's my misfortune...

534
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,733
Why are you ruining another life'?

535
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,430
A woman is a
man's responsibility.

536
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,236
You should take care of
her, protect her,

537
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,335
fulfill her every need.

538
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,612
When a man becomes a
woman's responsibility

539
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,310
and stays with her as
a househusband...

540
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,352
people call him impotent.

541
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,354
If you're impotent,
quietly stay here.

542
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,614
Why are you broadcasting
this shame'?

543
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,022
MI. Bansal...

544
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,550
Today I am truly proud
of your son.

545
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,725
Despite being horn in this house,
he is the Way he is.

546
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,428
If he had taken over you: business
& made you proud in society,

547
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,068
then you would call
him a "man"...

548
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,733
But fol a Woman...

549
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,536
a real man is one...

550
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,543
who knows he's a man.

551
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,279
Not one who isn't confident of
What's inside his underwear...

552
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,482
and has to shout
from the rooftops...

553
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,175
<i>"I'm</i> a <i>man! I'm</i> a <i>man!
I'm</i> a <i>man!"</i>

554
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,124
Today I consider myself the
luckiest woman in the world.

555
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,488
Because I have a real man
by my side.

556
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,327
Wish you would learn
something from you: son.

557
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,994
One minute...

558
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,173
Didn't buy it with my dad's money...
It's a gift from my uncle.

559
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,306
Underwear check?

560
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,700
Who's first?

561
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,340
Get serious!
We're getting married here!

562
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,511
Congrats!

563
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,276
Mom's...

564
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,032
Happy birthday.

565
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:29,662
Thank you

566
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,031
I'll go and reheat the tea.

567
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,376
So serious about you: duties
from day one'?

568
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,580
If I don't impress my wife
with my service,

569
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,053
she will kick me out!

570
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,416
I don't drink tea.

571
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,219
Then What do you drink
first thing in the morning?

572
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,090
Other than single malt.

573
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,224
Coffee.

574
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,192
Black, white, filter or instant'?

575
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,434
I am already
very impressed...

576
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,228
you relax I'll make it.

577
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,406
Black, white, filter or instant'?

578
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,303
Black. Filter.

579
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,373
Did you clean up?

580
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,341
No, I opened the Window,
a strong wind blew...

581
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,544
- the place got cleaned up!
- There is a maid to do all this...

582
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,747
- She comes at noon.
- No Women allowed in the kitchen.

583
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,388
This is my kitchen!

584
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,682
Coffee.

585
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,982
Thank you!

586
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,255
- And you: coffee'?
- Tea. Already had two cups.

587
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,491
Bathroom done, jogging
done, shower done...

588
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,165
There! Done praying too.

589
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,228
How's the coffee?

590
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,203
Nice, nice!

591
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,009
Good, good...

592
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,142
All members of this
household are requested...

593
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,183
to always speak the
truth to each other.

594
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,743
This maintains peace and
happiness at home.

595
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,719
Too much milk!

596
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,121
Too bitter!

597
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,620
Good.
Feedback leads to improvement

598
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,127
I'm a tea drinker.
It's the first time I'm making coffee.

599
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,526
How could you hide
such a big truth from me?

600
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,133
If I knew you didn't know
how to make coffee...

601
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,425
I would have never agreed to
this relationship.

602
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,298
Mom, We have been cheated!

603
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,103
Please forgive me.
It will never happen again!

604
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,101
Breakfast? Ornelette,
scrambled, half-fry, French toast?

605
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,043
We don't have breakfast.
Just coffee.

606
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,341
Which is Why you get acidity.

607
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,343
Ornelette, scrambled, half-fry,
French toast...

608
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,577
Gelucil or Digene'?

609
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,288
Stuffed potato parantha,
hot, flied puris...

610
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,253
can't you make?

611
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,589
You Were starving all these days.
Quietly eat whatever I make.

612
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,390
OK

613
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,189
Ornelette...

614
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,964
But it should he fluffy.

615
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,164
Just like in those
French recipe books!

616
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,395
Mummy fol you?

617
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,504
Not had!

618
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,042
What do you know about good and bad'?
It's the first time you're eating breakfast!

619
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,711
Eat something?

620
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,313
Ate long ago.

621
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,015
You thought I'd Wait?

622
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,313
Listen...

623
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,212
This evening...

624
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,015
come home late. No hurry.

625
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,218
What kind of a husband are you?

626
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:52,296
Aren't you ashamed of sending a woman
alone into this cruel world to earn for her family?

627
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,729
And where's you:
wedding chain'?

628
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,044
Now get lost.

629
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,713
Sorry! I just got really late

630
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,539
I'm surprised you
got up at all today.

631
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,552
Guys, Kia got
married secretly yesterday.

632
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,754

635
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,729
So Kia, how come

636
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,564
Where should I go'?

637
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,659
You just got married yesterday. Don't you
want to take a break? Spend some time at home'?

638
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,463
Rahul, What did you tell me?

639
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,233
You Were in meetings
even on your Wedding day.

640
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,440
So you're the Boss and
my inspiration is my Boss.

641
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,475
Don't remind rue! Sangeeta was waiting
at home with a knife in her hand.

642
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,571
On out first night together.

643
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,778
How do We explain
0111 work to Women?

644
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,279
Same problem...

645
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,780
How do We explain
0111 work to men?

646
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,336
Come over!

647
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,046
Brother, I thought
you were at work!

648
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,349
I am at work.

649
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,152
This is What goes on here?

650
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,656
- I've recorded everything.
- Sorry brother...

651
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,231
This is the first time
I've done this...

652
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,459
Shut up! Stop acting.

653
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,364
Now I'll call the police,
show them a movie.

654
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,800
Please forgive me brother...

655
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,231
I made a mistake,
I'll never do it again!

656
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,069
I'll do whatever you say!

657
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,073
Boyfriend, sex, love...
all are important.

658
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,074
But before using someone's
bed at least ask them!

659
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,476
- Changed the bed-sheet?
- Yes.

660
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,485
How much is your salary?

661
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,314
Ten thousand.

662
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,723
If you use the
bedroom again...

663
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,424
I'll deduct the
Whole ten thousand...

664
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,027
Room charge.

665
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,397
Sorry brother!

666
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,434
Please don't tell Madam...

667
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,700
From tomorrow
12 o'clock won't do...

668
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:20,733
Sharp 9.

669
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,706
Pick up the broom!

670
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,509
Let's drink cheap Whiskey.

671
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,210
See you in 20 minutes

672
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,120
I've found a new place that sells
expensive Whiskey fol cheap.

673
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,149
Where'?

674
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,460
If you do all this in
flout of me...

675
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,330
I'll also have to find
a lap to sit on.

676
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,032
Some one's been shopping'?

677
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,130
I brought him home
empty-handed...

678
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,271
He'd he roaming naked!

679
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,605
You have to spend some money.
Housewives don't come fol flee.

680
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,576
It's 10.30. Should we
order some food'?

681
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,379
Black lentils, cottage
cheese in butter,

00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,509
spicy ladyfinger,
yogurt with fried chickpeas...

683
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,314
Indian bread...

684
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,256
And above all, cumin rice.

685
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,485
What Kahit?

686
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:11,715
Why all this?

687
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,526
We could have ordered...

688
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,121
Food is "ordered" in a hotel...

689
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,032
at home food is "cooked".

690
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,532
But since you are
so fond of ordering...

691
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:22,999
Ham's the hill...

692
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,768
I need money...

693
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,109

00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,145
There is nobody like him!

695
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,618
He's got a thousand qualifies...

696
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,491
There is nobody like him!

697
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:05,207
Every gill Wishes she had

00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,177

We should have a party everyday,
at least then you'll come home early.

705
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,565
What was the need fol
catering, Kia?

00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:47,033

707
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,626
They are coming to meet you...

00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,129

What have you told
them about me?

714
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,274
What do they think I do?

715
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,183

Has no one asked you...

717
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,585
the first question everyone
asks after marriage...

718
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,088
What does your husband do?

719
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,984
I said you work from home and...

720
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,688
you're writing a book
or something.

721
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,989
Are you ashamed of me?

722
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,166
Do I embarrass you'?

723
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,101
Kabir...

724
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,975
It's very difficult for people to
understand out trip.

725
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,017
Sorry...

726
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,285
I'm really sorry

727
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,019
I'm so stupid.

728
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,624
Sometimes explaining to
people is such a pain...

729
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,361
It's so difficult that...

730
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,030
out of sheer laziness we just
avoid the topic.

731
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,633
But you know What?

732
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,639
I'm so proud of you

733
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,739
I'm so proud of What We are.

734
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:10,747
Let's show them today...

735
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,011
What We are.

736
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,492
Lovely house!

737
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,149
You know, your Wife
is going to go places!

738
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,458
- Cheers to that!
- Cheers!

739
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,194
Kia was saying that
you're writing a book?

740
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,126
Hey guys"-

741
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,730
I have an announcement
to make...

742
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,434
Before anyone else asks what
my husband does...

743
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,100
My husband is an artist.

744
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,135
Cheers!

745
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,107
My husband looks after 0111 home
so that I can go places.

746
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:17,209
My husband takes care of
0111 home, so that...

747
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:21,049
How do I translate
go places...'?

748
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:24,623
I can fly.

749
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,455
And he isn't writing any hook...

750
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,259
But someone will definitely write
a hook on him some day.

751
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,369
- So cheers to that guys!
- Cheers!

752
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,141
"I am not embarassed by you"...

753
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,373
You could have whispered
these words in my ear

754
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,181
I didn't ask you for proof!

755
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,154
Is this your mode
of transport?

756
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,426
I'm really sorry!

757
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,296
I don't know how that fell...

758
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,134
Relax.

759
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,737
So Kahit...

760
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,538
If Kia troubles you too much and
you feel like running away...

761
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,338
please come to my house!

762
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:42,363
No. Not today...
I have a headache.

763
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,471
To hell with your headache!

764
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,371
OK!

765
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,676
Tell Amol to give me the full sketch
of the plans today itself.

766
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,770
Yes today!

767
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,145
We are making a building.
Not some painting!

768
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,284
So?

769
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:00,978
Did your Wife throw you out?

770
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:05,092
MI. Singhal's daughter works
in you: wife's office...

771
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,493
Everyone is laughing at me

772
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,130
I'm getting condolence calls!

773
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,525
Have some shame!

774
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,133
Don't Waste your youth on
cooking lentils and rice.

775
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,531
Then-is still time.

776
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,136
Do some real work.

777
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,534
This time will never come hack.

778
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,602
No one will respect you!

779
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,112
Respect is earned by
doing a job Well.

780
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,741
You carry on making buildings
fol respect...

781
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,041
I'm making a home.

782
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,145
One of my signals broke...

783
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,245
Kishen Uncle!

784
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:37,454
Yes?

785
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,217
There are 2-3 led lights in the
drawer in my cupboard...

786
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,251
Can you please bring them?

787
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,126
I'll get them.

788
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,597

789
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,158

794
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,731

00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,045
OK, here's the first tip...

799
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,146
Marry an alcoholic...

800
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,616
they will at least
come home!

801
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,516
But a workaholic? Never!

802
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,314
She's always so busy

803
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,755
I told her let's celebrate our
honeymoon before we die.

804
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,048
She said, OK...

805
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,057

to Dubai...

806
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,357

I've also had CCTV's installed...

811
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:19,022
You can never trust your
house with the maid.

812
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,323
Which lady are you
flirting with?

813
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,524
I'm honeymooning with everyone's
wives except mine!

814
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,154
Haven't seen your boss
Rahul around.

815
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,023
He has been transferred
to the China office.

816
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,547
Now I report directly
to his boss.

817
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,148

823
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:24,714

One underwear check is equal to
45 minutes of walking.

902
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,734
Macho?

903
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,040

Actually... There's an
emergency

915
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,346
I'll have to sell this house.

919
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,715
Sit, do you know how hard I have
Worked to make this home?

920
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,485
Finding a house on lent
is such a pain!

921
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:15,026
Aren't there any flats
available in this building'?

922
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:17,727
Already checked.

923
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,438

01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,150
My full salary will go in paying

After a year or two We can
afford it Kabir.

932
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,225
The flat rate will increase
faster than you: salary.

933
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,464
We can never afford to.

934

Need money! Need money!

01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,572
If I work fol 2-3 years it will
solve the problem.

01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:10,514
Should I work or not'?
Work or not'? Work or not'? Work or not'?

01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:15,214
If I work I'll dive straight get caught up

To buy the house
We'll have to...

944
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,780

945
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,113
And than? And than?

What will you handle?

1025
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:59,149
Because you've earned some money,
you can handle anything?

1026
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:03,423
Why should your Wife have any dreams?
Get her pregnant and make her sit at home!

1027
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:05,322
A man's ultimate revenge!

1028
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,588
- Took your revenge?

What is it?

1032
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:34,383
Pregnancy tests are not
100% accurate...

1033
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:36,013
How accurate are they'?

If we pass, then we'll go to the
hospital and get properly tested.

1038
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,032
If you're definitely pregnant
we'll get an abortion done.

1039
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,267
You'll have the abortion?
Is the baby in you: stomach?

1040
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,568

So many?
Are you mad?

1045
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,314

Chill! Chill!

1050
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:37,150
Next...

1051
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,722
There's some problem...

This is the right one.

1055

- This is also negative.

1056
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:13,516
I knew it! I knew you're
not pregnant!

1057
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,021
Hey Kia!

1058
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:25,130
Negative! Negative!
3-2!

1059
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:29,294
How can you ever think
I'll stop your life?

01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:35,304
- Now why'?
- What if it's 3-3'?

1061
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,319
4-2 a

1062
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:55,256
I can't believe this!

1063
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,033
Whatever the problem...

1064
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,091
it's not Your's or Mine...
it's Ours.

1065
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,201
We're in this together.

1066
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:07,571
Don't take off on me
like that...

1067
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:09,368
Ever!

1068
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,013
I'm sorry baby!

1069
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,180
Then-is a product launch

so I just panicked!

1071
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,584
Forget that product.
If this product had launched...

1072
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,181
who would pay the
monthly installment?

1073
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,317
My problem is bigger than
you: problem!

1074
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,530
Now come. There's you: favourite
beans and rice for dinner. Come on.

1075
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,128
You marketing guys
don't understand.

1076
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:36,099
You: emotional ad campaign
won't do!

1077
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:37,626
The pressure of sales
is on me.

1078
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:39,004
We need an offer.

1079
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,633
To boost the sales,
Rs. 20 off immediately!

1080
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:44,109
You made an offer of
Rs. 10 off just 4 months ago!

1081
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,143
You sales guys will
kill the brand!

1082
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,347
- There will be no brand without buyers...
- Sit!

1083
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,116
This is short term thinking!

1084
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,114
Rs. 20 off is less.

1085
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,584
We should give 50% off.

1086
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,144
What?

1087
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,623
- But not fol Women.
- Meaning?

1088
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:00,989
50% off...

1089
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,092
if the men come to buy.

1090
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,095
Kia!

1091
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:05,363
You've lost it?

1092
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,693
Which man buys
cooking oil?

1093
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,329
Maybe in your house...

1094
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,568
If We tell Women...

1095
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,267
this offer is only for men...

1096
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,170
all of them will force their
men to go to the stores.

1097
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,211
Their love for the brand
will increase...

1098
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:24,014
because thanks to the brand, their
lifelong dream is being fulfilled...

1099
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:26,313
of getting men to shale the
responsibility of running the house.

1100
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,412
Why should caring fol the
health of the family...

1101
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,514
only be the wife's duty'? Men must
share that responsibility too.

1102
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,488
The house is in his name...

1103
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:36,127
so shouldn't he be doing
some housework too'?

1104
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,155
And one mole thing,
maybe because of this...

1105
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:42,227
your Wife also will start
liking you mole!

1106
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:44,760
Brilliant!

1107
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,331
Kia this is a
breakthrough idea!

1108
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,731
The whole Saffola range
should have this offer!

1109
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:04,980
Kabir...

1110
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,124
I got promoted to
Vice President Marketing!

1111
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,293
Here he is!

1112
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,199
From today onwards
training...

1113
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,998
- stops!
- What?

1114
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,269
Take care of you:
own bodies.

1115
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,004
- What do you mean?
- Why?

1116
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:28,079
Wife's status is rising.
Mother-in-laws status is changing.

1117
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,105
Too many responsibilities now...
no time!

1118
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,708
Don't do this Kabir,
you're my life!

1119
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,121
We had a target of 15 kilos,
only 6 has been achieved!

1120
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,213
We need you Kabir!

1121
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,654
But I don't need the money!

1122
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,754
- My god! You can't do this!
- Please!

1123
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,034
But... I Won't take money.

1124
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,632
- So no then.
- OK, OK!

1125
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:07,578
- Bye.
- Kia Wait!

1126
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,393
So late!
Have you eaten?

1127
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,297
Too tiled.

1128
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:01,540
How was your day?

1129
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:20,457
- It's Sunday.
- So?

1130
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,162
Don't you know What
Sunday means?

1131
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,754
Big review meeting tomorrow.
I'll have to go to office.

1132
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,159
Miss it!

1133
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,030
<i>'</i> Can't!
<i>'</i> can!

1134
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,066
Can't!

1135
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:55,384
For a woman to make a name in the
corporate world at such a young age...

1136
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,787
is still very rare Kia.
It's a big achievement

1137
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:00,056
I think it's equally
difficult for the men.

1138
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:01,719
Come on it's much
tougher on us.

1139
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:05,430
We have to excel both at
the office and at home.

1140
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,725
I only focus on my work...

1141
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,633
My husband takes
care of the house.

1142
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:12,631
Wow!
Is he fol real?

1143
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:15,099
Wish everyone had a
husband like yours

1144
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:17,038
I'd really like to
meet him!

1145
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,611
Kia What is this? Why did
you give them my number?

1146
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:23,241
- It's a small interview. No big deal.
- I don't like all this! Why are We doing this?

1147
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,217
I will benefit. Your interview
will give me mole publicity.

1148
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,652
OK bye now I have to go!

1149
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,251
Kabir thank you fol
letting us into your life.

1150
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,088
You have a beautiful home!

1151
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,452
- Thank you.
- When did you decide...

1152
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:39,657
that you would take care
of the house full time '.7.

1153
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,362
The first time I came to this
house and saw it's condition...

1154
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,735
I decided that the "men" in
this house needed a "Woman".

1155
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:50,774
So can we say that in you:
relationship, Kia is the man'?

1156
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,578
No...

1157
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,248
Kia is a Woman,
and I am a

1158
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:59,281
but I understand
you: confusion.

1159
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:02,416
Homemaker means you're a "she",
having a career means you're a "he"...

1160
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,285
According to "Indian tradition".

1161
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:09,318
True, hut Kia is a very successful Woman
& you are dependent on her financially...

1162
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:13,427
Does you: ego ever hurt'?
Do you feel jealous?

1163
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,091
So you're saying that...

1164
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:18,730
all those women who are homemakers are
jealous of their husband's success?

1165
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,634
Using their money to run
the house hurts their ego'?

1166
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:26,337
If Women don't feel it,
Why do you think men will feel...

1167
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,244
jealous... have an ego?

1168
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:32,043
Maybe men's upbringing,
genetic difference...

1169
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:33,745
Of course.
We are different...

1170
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:37,021
Which is why I don't wear a bra &
she doesn't have a beard.

1171
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:40,250
But genes don't say that
a bra can't go to work...

1172
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,317
or that a beard can't
run the house.

1173
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:45,154
My "she" is proving
to the world...

1174
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,262
that she's no less
than a "he"...

1175
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,631
And this "he" is proving
to the world...

1176
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:51,534
that he's no less
than a "she"!

1177
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,469
The Constitution of India gives
every citizen the freedom of choice.

1178
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:58,442
She and he have the freedom
to choose what they want to do.

1179
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:01,614
We chose this life. Why is it
breaking news to you'?

1180
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:03,405
Kia!

1181
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,617
I saw your husband's
"He-She" interview...

1182
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,311
Damn cool!

1183
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,614
What a dude your
husband is!

1184
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:11,715
For a minute even I was
influenced by his words!

1185
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,516
You're a very
lucky gill!

1186
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:16,027
You: husband is a very
progressive man.

1187
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,695
Yes. All companies should
recruit more women

1188
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,099
I wish more of out men were like him.
He's from INM(B), right'?

1189
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,999
Kia, your husband's trending!

1190
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:26,334
Let's get hack to work guys.

1191
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,429
Hi Ma'am...

1192
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:29,404
I saw your interview...

1193
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:33,141
- Thank you!
- I loved What you Were Wearing!

1194
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,312
You've become an
overnight stat!

1195
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:45,457
Saw the interview?
I gave you so much publicity!

1196
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,353
Me? You Were
praising yourself!

1197
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,752
Anyway you looked hot!

1198
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:54,557
It was a question of your reputation!
I did the make-up and lighting myself.

1199
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,416
What did you mean "condition
of the house" before you came?

1200
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,584
Did we live in the
gutter before'?

1201
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,620
That was a joke...
A true joke.

1202
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:23,419
And What was that...

1203
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:27,089
"She" is proving to the world that
she's no less than a "he"...

1204
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,030
That was a compliment!

1205
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:34,132
What do you think?
That my life's

1206
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:37,506
is to show people that
I'm no less than a man?

1207
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,645
I'm not proving anything
to anyone, OK?

1208
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,045
I just Want to he the best
at What I do.

1209
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,312
She finds faults
even in compliments!

1210
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:50,414
You said something?

1211
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:59,555
I saw your son on T.V.

1212
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:01,967
But Women's Day is
next month...

1213
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,169
What was he
doing on T.V.'.7.

1214
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:07,102
Sit, he speaks very Well.

1215
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,164
- Did he say anything about me?
- No sit...

1216
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,108
He didn't even take
your name.

1217
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,609
Thank God...

1218
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,410
else 0111 apartment
prices would fall!

1219
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,521
- Hello?
- Hi, is this MI. Kabir Bansal?

1220
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:27,719
Yes, speaking.

1221
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:31,321
Sit We would like you to talk in
0111 Ted X Program.

1222
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:40,291
- What is this? I'm starving!
- Sorry!

1223
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,362
What will you have?

1224
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,199
Just order anything!

1225
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,004
Hello?

1226
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,103
Sit, we're doing a cookery show...

1227
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,130
- Don't you think'?
- Clutter-breaking idea, sit!

1228
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:59,310
Sit I know it's
very interesting...

1229
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,378
but I don't think he'll do it.

1230
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,438
Television is going to die.

1231
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:05,549
Who will Watch T.V. with
so many ads?

1232
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,676
They should ban ads!

1233
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:10,078
When-is mom?

1234
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,181
Some NGO seminar
or something.

1235
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:13,582
Drink?

1236
01:29:14,248 --> 01:29:16,091
You Won't believe it...

1237
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,992
my boss Wants to
cast you in an ad.

1238
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:20,398
Excuse me?

1239
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:22,695
Don't Worry...
I said no.

1240
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:25,597
Which ad?

1241
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:29,037
Saffola!

1242
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:30,532
Saffola?

1243
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:36,705
Saffola...

1244
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,983
Actually Kia it's
a good idea.

1245
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:43,121
You: last "offer" idea for men
was such a hit...

1246
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:44,178
Actually...

1247
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,714
it's a great idea!

1248
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,324
How long will we
stereotype women in ads'?

1249
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,425
Ads influence society, right?

1250
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,622
Change ads,
change society!

1251
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,391
You'll do an ad?

1252
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:44,106
Kia, I Want Kabir to give 0111
Marketing & Sales team...

1253
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:46,778
an inspirational talk. Just
an informal evening session.

1254
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:49,644
He's such an interesting man.
I'm sure people will love it!

1255
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:51,546
Kabir?

1256
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:52,454
<i>Hale'!?</i>

1257
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:52,645
You're really enjoying you:
new life, aren't you'?

1258
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:56,777
I really enjoyed
coming to you: office.

1259
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:59,258
But how do you
work there'?

1260
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:01,719
I Wasn't talking about
this evening.

1261
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,128
What do you mean?

1262
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,724
I mean...

1263
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:10,125
all these talks and speeches...

1264
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:15,702
At first I found these interviews &
talks on gender equality very irritating.

1265
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:19,005
But after seeing the initial
Response, I started.

1266
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:21,636
If I can do some good,
then Why not?

1267
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:24,140
What good are you doing?

1268
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,446
By sharing out lives...

1269
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,453
if someone else's life
gets better, then why not'?

1270
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:36,051
I thought I was the marketing person,
and you didn't like marketing...

1271
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:40,758
You are marketing
your life!

1272
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:44,225
0111 life!

1273
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:46,232
Not my life.

1274
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:49,572
My life is not so different.

1275
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:51,567
So many women work...

1276
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,046
You're the different animal!

1277
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:57,077
And anyway who are
you helping?

1278
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:01,279
You think that centuries of
injustice done to Women...

1279
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:04,119
can he wiped clean in a
second by your example?

1280
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,285
It's the men, not the Women
who are benefiting from this.

1281
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:11,725
Inspired by you, men think they can
sit at home & become stats!

1282
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,631
If you don't want to work...

1283
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:17,628
why encourage others
to be useless.

1284
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:34,151
That you find happiness
in my happiness.

1285
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:37,348
Is not necessary in love...

1286
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:47,227
If 0111 paths don't meet...

1287
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:50,599
does not mean We are apart...

1288
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:54,195
This is love, not duty...

1289
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:57,435
This is love, not duty...

1290
01:33:57,498 --> 01:34:00,604
This is love, not duty...

1291
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,444
This is love, not duty...

1292
01:34:03,504 --> 01:34:05,575
I have some good news.

1293
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:08,986
We Want to send you to New Yolk
for a management pro gramme.

1294
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:11,015

1295
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:12,584

and go to the U.S.
fol a month?

1301
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,038

1302
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:30,039
What alone? I'm not going

1303
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:32,301
I'm just joking...

1304
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:34,112
What's happened to you Kabir?

1305
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:36,005
He's become famous mom...

1306
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,044
- He doesn't have dates.
- What?

1307
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:40,045
Everything stops from today.

1308
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:41,342
What?

1309
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:42,453
Anyway...

1310
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,717

1311
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:45,746
and getting corrupted!

1312
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:47,023
What?

1313
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,157
How can I leave you in
this condition?

1314
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:51,352
What's happened to me?

1315
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:54,657
Anything can happen. Anyway my job
is to take care of the house...

1316
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:56,659
not to travel the world!

1317
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:01,662
I'm sorry...

1318
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:03,507
For what?

1319
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:06,370
Why Won't you come?

1320
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:08,604

You'll he busy...

1323
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:22,517
Instead of living there without you
it's better if I stay here without you.

1324
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:26,325
At least I can look
after mom.

1325
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:28,732
I Want to he useful.

1326
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:35,735
Then I Won't go too.

1327
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:36,633
Don't go!

1328
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:41,209
But I've already accepted...

1329
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:44,505
and it's a great
opportunity to learn.

1330
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:46,245
So go...

1331
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:57,126
I didn't mean What I
said in the cat

1332
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,158
I mean What I'm
saying now.

1333
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,363
You do your work,
I'll do mine.

1334
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,263
Anyway you feel that
I don't do anything.

1335
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:08,673
If I come to America
with you and enjoy...

1336
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,335
even I'll feel that
I'm useless!

1337
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:27,222
I don't know how to convince you...

1338
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:30,125
This is love, not duty...

1339
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:33,597
Does not mean I desire you any less.

1340
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,726
This is love, not duty...

1341
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:42,202
Times have changed a hit,
But I'm the same, my love...

1342
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:49,670
How do I make you understand

1343
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:56,682
I don't know how to make you happy
But I Want to see a smile on your face.

1344
01:36:56,744 --> 01:37:00,123
This is love, not duty...

1345
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:03,390
This is love, not duty...

1346
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:06,659
This is love, not duty...

1347
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,564
This is love, not duty...

1348
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:13,402
That you find happiness
in my happiness.

1349
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,373
Is not necessary in love...

1350
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:20,106
That you find happiness
in my happiness.

1351
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:23,114
Is not necessary in love...

1352
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:26,549
If 0111 paths don't meet...

1353
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:31,386
does not mean We are apart...

1354
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:33,483
Where are you going all
dressed up like a stud?

1355
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:39,087
To focus on my
present life...

1356
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,326
I had made my past
out of focus...

1357
01:37:41,722 --> 01:37:44,134
But now my past is
calling out to me.

1358
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:47,504
After many years then-is a
reunion of all the MBA robots.

1359
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:48,335
Shall I go?

1360
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:51,035
If you come home early
sleep outside!

1361
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:57,142
So you learned
how to cook?

1362
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:58,239
Yes, completely!

1363
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:13,696
- Hi Kabir!
- Hi Neha.

1364
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:16,001
- How's Kia?
- She's good. Very good.

1365
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:18,193
When Z people have
a scene in college...

1366
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:19,397
and they lose touch...

1367
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,565
and meet after
many years...

1368
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:24,269
that moment guys...
is pule sex!

1369
01:38:28,435 --> 01:38:29,743
Here! Sex done'?

1370
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,418
- What are you drinking?
- I Want to get drunk!

1371
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:36,352
I Want to have shots!

1372
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:42,494
Kabir...

1373
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:46,394
You gave me a big
complex in college...

1374
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:49,424
Now that I'm Worth
400 million dollars, and single...

1375
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:51,192
you still make me
feel like a loser!

1376
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:52,532
What did I do?

1377
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,606
You're the one who is in every
Woman's dream even after marriage!

1378
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:04,241
You've become a film director but
still didn't bring an actress along.

1379
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:07,309
Your life is no less than a film.
How much fol the copyrights?

1380
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:10,281
- Kahit?
- Yes?

1381
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:11,651
Will you come to
Mumbai fol me?

1382
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:13,123
Why is your husband
in Delhi?

1383
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:15,421
No in Paris. Ass!

1384
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:19,091
My channel is doing a big
pro gramme for Women's Day...

1385
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:20,961
I stopped doing all that...

1386
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:22,991
Please do it fol me?

1387
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:24,468
Just one day! Please?

1388
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:27,165
How many times can I say the
same thing? Anyway it's Women's Day...

1389
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:29,401
Women should speak fol
the benefit of Women to Women!

1390
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:32,405
For Women to benefit
men should speak to men.

1391
01:39:32,433 --> 01:39:34,640
No, you find yourself
another man

1392
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:36,480
I've committed...

1393
01:39:37,004 --> 01:39:38,642
I'll he badly screwed!

1394
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:41,316
Just one day...
Please!

1395
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:43,179
Please!

1396
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:44,682
Please!

1397
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:26,521
(Kabir: History says, in the stone ages
men hunted and Women in caves cooked...)

1398
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,299
No one checked how
many men cooked...

1399
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,360
and how many Women hunted!

1400
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:39,338
If you miss 1 match out of 121
it Won't make any difference...

1401
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,176
Today's Women's Day, sit with your
Woman and listen to this boy!

1402
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:44,580
If we reversed the roles,
then what?

1403
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:46,648
The Woman's job would he hunting...

1404
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:48,277
the man's job, cooking!

1405
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:50,318
Only their responsibilities
would have been swapped.

1406
01:40:50,577 --> 01:40:51,783
Men would have Remained men...

1407
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:53,218
Women would have Remained Women...

1408
01:40:53,647 --> 01:40:55,752
Sex would have been just as good!
Yes, but today We...

1409
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,588
would not be celebrating
Women's Day...

1410
01:40:57,684 --> 01:40:58,662
but Men's Day instead!

1411
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:02,592
History must have been written
by a man!

1412
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:04,392
His-tory...

1413
01:41:04,591 --> 01:41:06,730
The clue is in the wold itself,
His Story!

1414
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:08,538
Does anyone know
Her Story?

1415
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:11,041
- Who's this fellow?
- He's a man!

1416
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:12,408
I can see that.

1417
01:41:12,433 --> 01:41:15,778
The men who discovered the Hindi language
knew this about this mistake...

1418
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:19,549
In Hindi grammar,
"cooking" is a masculine gender...

1419
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:21,315
So cooking is
male territory.

1420
01:41:21,341 --> 01:41:24,618
"Working" is a feminine gender...

1421
01:41:25,546 --> 01:41:26,650
Female territory!

1422
01:41:27,548 --> 01:41:28,720
Fact is...

1423
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:31,457
we ale speaking one language,
and living another.

1424
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:37,661
He takes care of his home
so his Wife can fulfill? her dreams.

1425
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:39,067
Good!

1426
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:41,195
Good? Could you have
ever done this?

1427
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,365
Yes, Why not?

1428
01:41:42,529 --> 01:41:45,169
Rubbish! If I had
continued my acting work...

1429
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:46,472
would you have taken
care of the house?

1430
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:48,772
Absolutely. If that was
your dream.

1431
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:53,282
You can't boil a glass of
water on you: own!

1432
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,581
We would have got a cook.
Does he have kids?

1433
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,179
- That's not the point!
- That's the point...

1434
01:41:57,244 --> 01:41:58,689
That's the big point Jaya!

1435
01:41:59,146 --> 01:42:00,750
When did I stop you
from Working?

1436
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:02,118
It was your choice!

1437
01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:06,096
Exactly. It was my choice
because I had no other choice!

1438
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:09,024
What are you saying!

1439
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:11,034
I would have happily
looked after the house!

1440
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,160
sure!

1441
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:16,038
Amitahh Bachchan cooking
in the kitchen...

1442
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:20,601
and Jaya Bachchan happily
Waving to her fans every Sunday!

1443
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:21,737
You would have
been OK with it?

1444
01:42:22,002 --> 01:42:23,140
Yeah.
Why not?

1445
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:26,047
So easy to say it.
Can't rewind life!

1446
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:31,221
What do I do?

1447
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:33,256
What do you Want
me to do?

1448
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:35,418
- I Want to meet this boy.
- Who? This guy?

1449
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:36,652
- Yeah.
- Why?

1450
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,162
I like him.
Just look at him!

1451
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,101
At this age a new threat!

1452
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:49,673
Hi. You coming?

1453
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:51,370
Corning where?

1454
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:53,672
So Why did you call?

1455
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:55,474
I just called to say...

1456
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:59,040
I called to say I'm meeting
Amitahh Bachchan & Jaya Bachchan!

1457
01:42:59,573 --> 01:43:00,608
What?

1458
01:43:00,974 --> 01:43:02,317
I'm in Mumbai.

1459
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:03,683
What are you doing
in Mumbai?

1460
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:07,090
Then-is a Women's Day
seminar...

1461
01:43:07,447 --> 01:43:08,585
Another speech...

1462
01:43:09,216 --> 01:43:10,251
Started again?

1463
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:13,194
I thought you Wasn't going
to do all this!

1464
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:18,728
This is Why you didn't
come with me, right?

1465
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:21,604
Anyway. Good...

1466
01:43:21,995 --> 01:43:22,735

Thank you!

1471
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,117
What wrong did I
do to you'?

1472
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:55,158
I'll have to heat her
lectures fol days!

1473
01:45:03,664 --> 01:45:07,476
Kia, 20 missed calls?
Mom...!

1474
01:45:20,013 --> 01:45:21,185
What happened?

1475
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:25,093
Her BP was very low.
She collapsed.

1476
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:26,654
She was trying to
call you.

1477
01:45:27,521 --> 01:45:29,194
She called Kia,
Kia called me...

1478
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:31,627
We had to rush her here.

1479
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,503
Kia was saying...

1480
01:45:34,528 --> 01:45:38,066
she'll catch some flight via
Zurich and leach by tonight.

1481
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:54,059
- Hello?
- Where are you'?

1482
01:45:54,114 --> 01:45:55,718
Kia you've landed...

1483
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:57,353
I'm almost there!

1484
01:45:57,417 --> 01:45:59,192
I'm already in the
bloody hospital!

1485
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:07,733
Flight arrived early?

1486
01:46:18,138 --> 01:46:20,675
- Swiss air was supposed to...
- I came by Lufthansa.

1487
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:23,211
- Why didn't you call me?
- Call you?

1488
01:46:23,276 --> 01:46:24,619
The whole world was
trying to call you!

1489
01:46:24,678 --> 01:46:26,624
Why did you come hack?
Go give mole speeches!

1490
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:30,628
Nothing’s happened. Mom is flue. You
didn't have to leave work & rush here

1491
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:31,628
I came. I'm here!

1492
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,062
You Were not here!

1493
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:39,137
What is this sudden trip
to become famous'?

1494
01:46:39,326 --> 01:46:42,205
Why do you suddenly want to
show the world how great you are'?

1495
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:46,133
You left home to tell the world
how well you run a home'?

1496
01:46:46,299 --> 01:46:48,040
You're a bloody fraud!

1497
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:50,513
This is a hospital.
Please go outside.

1498
01:46:51,138 --> 01:46:53,414
Kia! I Went to meet
Amitahh Bachchan...

1499
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:56,420
Did mom's blood pressure know that
you Were with Amitahh Bachchan?

1500
01:46:56,777 --> 01:46:59,417
If Amitahh Bachchan knew
that my mom was dying...

1501
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:02,323
and you Were telling stories of
being a "cool husband"...

1502
01:47:02,382 --> 01:47:04,259
he would have thrown you out!

1503
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:06,161
My phone was on silent...

1504
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:08,096
there Were no flights out.
I took the first...

1505
01:47:08,188 --> 01:47:12,102
You're living off my money and you
want to show the world how great you are'?

1506
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,263
OI is it that because
I'm older than you...

1507
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:16,329
you're doing me a favour
by living with me.

1508
01:47:17,597 --> 01:47:18,575
Kia listen...

1509
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:21,306
Now that you're on T.V. and
a social celebrity...

1510
01:47:21,334 --> 01:47:24,577
you: "homemaker" & "don't want to
move ahead" act is over'?

1511
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:25,708
Kia...

1512
01:47:26,506 --> 01:47:28,417
You don't want to progress!

1513
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:29,715
The joke of the century!

1514
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:31,714
You are the cheapest, slimiest...

1515
01:47:31,978 --> 01:47:33,980
most manipulative
man in this world.

1516
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,492
Why are you living off Inc...

1517
01:47:41,188 --> 01:47:43,429
when you are the heir
to millions?

1518
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:46,597
Why? Why? Why?

1519
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,441
You used me!

1520
01:47:57,103 --> 01:47:58,309
I'm such a fool!

1521
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:00,379
It was pule strategy!

1522
01:48:00,574 --> 01:48:02,986
You plotted this hit by hit!

1523
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:06,086
It was all a set-up!

1524
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:08,393
Nothing was a coincidence...

1525
01:48:09,115 --> 01:48:10,355
from the Chandigarh-Delhi
flight until now...

1526
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:12,385
Was it really you: dead
mother's birthday that day'?

1527
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:15,294
Brilliant game, brilliant
bloody game!

1528
01:48:15,355 --> 01:48:17,062
You proved that you're an
MBA topper.

1529
01:48:17,224 --> 01:48:18,999
What a business plan!

1530
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:22,599
I'll become a hem not by
inventing anything...

1531
01:48:22,696 --> 01:48:25,700
not by becoming yet another
millionaire, not by anything. Just...

1532
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:27,672
by doing nothing!

1533
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:30,412
Without doing anything I will
leave my mark in the world.

1534
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:32,709
You are an artist...

1535
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:35,216
The World's biggest
con artist!

1536
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:40,320
You used me to laugh at your dad...
to laugh at the whole bloody world...

1537
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:42,382
Kia...

1538
01:48:42,582 --> 01:48:44,687
Kia, let's go hack.
Mom is alone.

1539
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:47,996
My mom. My home

1540
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:49,498
I'll take care of it.

1541
01:49:38,705 --> 01:49:39,979
Dear Kia...

1542
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:42,175
We really missed you.

1543
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:45,012
Kabir told us a lot about you

1544
01:49:45,312 --> 01:49:47,223
I'm truly, truly proud of you.

1545
01:49:47,714 --> 01:49:50,718
I know the world is
celebrating Kabir today...

1546
01:49:51,217 --> 01:49:54,391
but without a Kia,
a Kabir cannot exist.

1547
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:57,395
Every Woman Wishes fol
a husband like this...

1548
01:49:57,424 --> 01:50:01,497
but very few have the courage
to love such a man.

1549
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:04,098
It takes a lot fol a
man to he a Kahit...

1550
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:07,244
But it takes a lot mole fol
a Woman to he happy...

1551
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:09,245
with a man like Kabir.

1552
01:50:09,336 --> 01:50:11,646
You are a big inspiration!

1553
01:50:12,038 --> 01:50:15,212
I wish the world would
have more women like you, Kia.

1554
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:17,355
God bless you!

1555
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:24,528
That you find happiness...

1556
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:27,464
in my happiness.

1557
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:33,160
Is not necessary in love...

1558
01:50:35,095 --> 01:50:41,478
If 0111 paths don't meet...

1559
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:47,142
does not mean We are apart...

1560
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:50,477
When-is Kabir?

1561
01:50:52,212 --> 01:50:53,350
Kia!

1562
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,289
I'm so cheap mom!

1563
01:50:55,348 --> 01:50:56,793
I hate myself I.

1564
01:50:58,084 --> 01:50:59,688
I felt jealous of him!

1565
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,200
How can I he jealous
of Kabir mom?

1566
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:04,401
I love him, I love him
mole than my life!

1567
01:51:04,424 --> 01:51:05,994
Calm down Kia!

1568
01:51:06,026 --> 01:51:08,028
He got a little attention...

1569
01:51:08,561 --> 01:51:10,006
and I couldn't handle it!

1570
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:12,507
I feel so small mom!

1571
01:51:13,033 --> 01:51:14,376
I'm feeling so small.

1572
01:51:14,534 --> 01:51:16,309
How can I he
insecure of him?

1573
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:18,412
Kabir loves you too.

1574
01:51:18,438 --> 01:51:21,009
Not once did he say that
I wasn't at home either.

1575
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:24,586
And I abused him fol not
being there fol just one night!

1576
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:25,782
What happened Kia?

1577
01:51:26,046 --> 01:51:29,493
This is love, not duty...

1578
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:10,631
I really didn't mean what I said!
I didn't mean what I said morn...

1579
01:52:11,124 --> 01:52:12,728
Of coulee you meant it.

1580
01:52:13,426 --> 01:52:15,099
Else you Wouldn't have said it.

1581
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:18,103
I didn't mean What I said

1582
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:19,735
I really love Kabir!

1583
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,738
Love is not the problem...

1584
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:25,410
There is no problem
between Kabir and you.

1585
01:52:25,672 --> 01:52:29,586
Infant, this is not a
husband-Wife, man-Woman...

1586
01:52:29,642 --> 01:52:31,644
or... What is that...

1587
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:35,249
not even a "he-she" problem...

1588
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:41,160
This is a basic issue between a
homemaker and the person who earns...

1589
01:52:42,122 --> 01:52:46,264
Whether it's a "she" or a "he"...

1590
01:52:47,127 --> 01:52:51,769
Unfortunately, the world only sees the
person who earns in the relationship

1591
01:52:52,165 --> 01:52:55,374
because of which the person
gets used to the attention.

1592
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:57,137
It's natural!

1593
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:00,474
No one notices the homemaker...

1594
01:53:00,974 --> 01:53:04,217
Slowly, even the earning member
stops noticing the homemaker.

1595
01:53:05,411 --> 01:53:09,518
When the world by chance
notices the homemaker...

1596
01:53:09,749 --> 01:53:13,492
then natal-ally, the
homemaker feels a bit nice...

1597
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:17,524
and the earning member
feels a bit shaken.

1598
01:53:17,724 --> 01:53:19,726
Hey! I'm the hem!

1599
01:53:20,126 --> 01:53:22,697
How can the supporting actor
equal to me!

1600
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:25,006
But I'm not like that mom!

1601
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:27,108
You are exactly like that!

1602
01:53:27,567 --> 01:53:29,342
We are all I'.ike that.

1603
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:31,340
<i>W eke human beings'.!</i>

1604
01:53:31,738 --> 01:53:35,151
But you know What is so
beautiful about you?

1605
01:53:36,109 --> 01:53:38,282
You don't Want to he like that.

1606
01:53:52,258 --> 01:53:55,796
Credit card used for
Vistara Airlines... 5,000'?

1607
01:53:56,229 --> 01:53:57,264
Kahit!

1608
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:07,583
Hello? Yes?

1609
01:54:08,141 --> 01:54:11,281
Can you tell me if MI. Kabir Bansal
is traveling on any of your flights today?

1610
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:16,426
His Wife is dying!
It's an emergency!

1611
01:54:18,284 --> 01:54:20,525
If I knew the flight number
Why would I he calling you?

1612
01:54:23,623 --> 01:54:25,159
What is UK246?

1613
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:28,102
Chandigarh?

1614
01:54:28,127 --> 01:54:31,074
You Were in Chandigarh
to buy Chandigarh?

1615
01:54:31,097 --> 01:54:33,043
No.
My friend had a break-up...

1616
01:54:33,099 --> 01:54:34,339
I was there for rnoral support

1617
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:20,587
I'm sorry!

1618
01:55:20,613 --> 01:55:23,025
I'm really sorry.

1619
01:55:25,451 --> 01:55:27,624
I was just missing
my husband.

1620
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:30,398
But I'm OK now...

1621
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:40,011
He loved his mom a lot.

1622
01:55:45,004 --> 01:55:46,540
During take off and landing...

1623
01:55:48,341 --> 01:55:50,719
he would hold her hand
tightly like this.

1624
01:56:04,557 --> 01:56:05,399
Yes sit?

1625
01:56:05,558 --> 01:56:07,697
Ma'am can you get this
lady her husband please?

1626
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:12,370
I lost him somewhere!

1627
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:25,088
Found him!

1628
01:56:39,025 --> 01:56:40,333
Over!

1629
01:56:41,127 --> 01:56:42,697
What's over?

1630
01:56:43,229 --> 01:56:45,038
Murder.

1631
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:47,007
- Whose?
- Yours!

1632
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:50,443
I smashed you, bashed you,
chopped your body into pieces...

1633
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:52,005
and took my revenge.

1634
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:53,616
Peace!

1635
01:57:02,348 --> 01:57:06,160
Folded my hands, pleaded, got down
on my knees, asked for forgiveness.

1636
01:57:06,586 --> 01:57:08,065
Got it!

1637
01:57:10,056 --> 01:57:11,558
Peace!

1638
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:19,170
But Why did you come
after me so quickly?

1639
01:57:20,066 --> 01:57:23,707
I can understand if my
friend was a "she"...

1640
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:27,014
If you: friend was a "she"...

1641
01:57:27,306 --> 01:57:29,115
this plane Wouldn't have
lauded in Chandigarh.

1642
01:57:29,308 --> 01:57:31,219
You could have shown up
before hoarding...

1643
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:33,381
We could have saved money
on the return ticket!

1644
01:57:37,083 --> 01:57:39,188
We will come hack by train.

1645
01:57:40,486 --> 01:57:42,227
I Want to feel...

1646
01:57:43,222 --> 01:57:45,202
the romance of trains!

1647
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:03,547
Happy birthday m you!

1648
01:58:04,077 --> 01:58:08,583
Happy birthday m you!

1649
01:58:15,388 --> 01:58:17,561

1650
01:58:17,723 --> 01:58:20,169

- I don't Want anything dad.

1651
01:58:20,326 --> 01:58:22,101
Thank you fol coming.

1652
01:58:22,295 --> 01:58:24,275
Just enjoy a meal
cooked by your son.

1653
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:25,502
Who's giving you anything?

1654
01:58:26,999 --> 01:58:29,377
On the occasion of my
daughter-in-law's birthday...

1655
01:58:29,402 --> 01:58:31,279
I've come to ask her fol a gift.

1656
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:34,685
To take my company forward...

1657
01:58:35,575 --> 01:58:37,714
I need a CEO.

1658
01:58:38,244 --> 01:58:39,382
A CEO...

1659
01:58:40,446 --> 01:58:42,187
who after I'm gone...

1660
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:44,528
can take over my company.

1661
01:58:47,019 --> 01:58:48,123
Me?

1662
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:50,224
I think I'm too
small fol this...

1663
01:58:50,323 --> 01:58:51,233
You're very talented.

1664
01:58:51,691 --> 01:58:54,228
I keep track of all your work!

1665
01:58:56,028 --> 01:58:57,234
Cheers!

1666
01:58:59,465 --> 01:59:01,536
Is he offering me dowry
in the middle of the night?

1667
01:59:01,601 --> 01:59:03,444
He's making sure
the family business...

1668
01:59:03,469 --> 01:59:05,574
is being handed over
to the right family member.

1669
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,347
Are you interested in
charity work?

1670
01:59:10,009 --> 01:59:13,081
Charity? What charity?

1671
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:16,387
Till today I thought that behind
every successful

1672
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:18,052
there is a Woman.

1673
01:59:18,084 --> 01:59:20,257
And you: son proved that...

1674
01:59:20,286 --> 01:59:23,358
behind a successful
Woman there is a man.

1675
01:59:23,589 --> 01:59:25,330
No, no...

1676
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:27,302
You daughter has
proved that...

1677
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,397
there needs to he a
successful Woman...

1678
01:59:29,462 --> 01:59:32,068
in flout of every
unsuccessful man!

1679
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:36,378
When did you last do an
underwear cheek?

1680
01:59:37,637 --> 01:59:39,173
What's that?
