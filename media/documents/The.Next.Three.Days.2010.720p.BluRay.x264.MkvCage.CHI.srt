No. I walked him to his class, gave
him a kiss, he just walked right in.

191
00:10:57,461 --> 00:11:00,031
Didn't even turn
back for a wave.

192

Well, it's only been
a couple of years,

201

I'm sure she'll
get around to it.

00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,356
Don't.

207

It can take months for a

208
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,361
I saw that woman.
She was there.

209
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:03,113
She couldn't have
just disappeared.

210
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,648
Meyer is looking for
a new investigator.

211
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,685
Her coat snagged my purse,
and I felt that button pop,

212
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,387
and they're blind
if they can't find it.

He's gonna go through
all the evidence again.

Not anymore.

Okay. That's that.

00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,683
All we have now is

255

John, in the last 30 years,

256
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:41,624
the Supreme Court has not
heard one murder case.

257

No decent lawyer would
even file the pleadings.

That shouldn't be too hard.

I've seen the
evidence, Meyer.

265
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:17,145
I'm not saying judge her innocent or
guilty, I'm just saying look at it.

266
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:21,500
Her co-worker sees
her leaving the scene,

267
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:23,619
the victim's blood
is on her clothes,

268
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:25,688
her fingerprints are
on the murder weapon.

269
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:27,390
And then we went
out to dinner.

270
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,776
How do you do that if you
just killed somebody?

271
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:30,977

her a psychopath.

- Is Lara a psychopath?

But this one
ended up dead.

276
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:42,006
So what you're saying is that you
never believed in her innocence?

277
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,874
- How can you say that?
- What are you saying, Meyer?

278
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,978
I'm saying that it no longer
matters what we believe,

00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,413
Lara is not getting out!

00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:41,349
Each one has a key.
You just have to find it.

343
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:42,818
How do you do that?

344
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:45,954
A lot of looking.

345
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:49,041
Especially at things that
break up the daily routine.

346
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:52,561
Guards get comfortable doing the
same thing day in, day out.

347
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:55,264
Something happens,
that's when they make mistakes.

348
00:24:55,332 --> 00:24:58,134
When you see it,
you have to be ready.

349
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:00,637
You have to have the entire
plan already in place,

350
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:03,607
even before you know how you're
going to get out of jail.

351
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:07,611
Escaping is easy, the hardest
part is staying free.

352
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:09,696
You have to know
where you're gonna go

353
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:11,849
and how you're
gonna get there.

354
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:16,220
You have to know how they plan
to catch you, where and when.

355
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,588
Well, how the hell are you
supposed to know that?

356
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:20,658
You pay off someone
who knows.

357
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:23,577
And a lot depends on if the prison
is in the country or the city.

358
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:24,762
City.

359
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:38,109
Where are you from?

360
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:40,812
Pittsburgh.

361
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:41,998
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>

362
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:46,819
Pittsburgh's tough.

363
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:50,723
<font color="#808080">DAMON:</font> <i>So many bridges and
tunnels they can block off.</i>

364
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,058

365
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:56,595
<i>the police can have the center of the
city sealed tight in 15 minutes.</i>

366
00:25:56,663 --> 00:25:58,515
How can they be so exact?

367
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:02,352
After 9/11, Homeland Security made
every city have a lockdown plan.

368
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:06,657
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly,
Boston, Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

369
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:08,725
They can do D.C.
in under 10.

370
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,660
<i>Within 35 minutes,</i>
<i>they can have cops</i>

371
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,796
<i>at every tollbooth</i>
<i>on the interstate</i>

372
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,716
<i>and be running rolling stops</i>
<i>on the secondary roads.</i>

373
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,068
<i>They won't have</i>
<i>your photograph yet,</i>

374
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:19,921
<i>but they will have</i>
<i>your description.</i>

375
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:22,590
What if you can't get out?
Thirty-five minutes is not a lot of time.

376
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:24,459
Then surrender.

377
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:28,679
Because they will shoot you on sight,
along with anyone else you're with.

378
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:31,399
Stay far away from the
train and bus stations.

379
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,803
<i>Forget the local airports.</i>
<i>Leave from another state.</i>

380
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:37,839
Second, identity.
It's easy to find fake papers,

381
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:40,659
harder to find ones that will
get you through an airport.

382
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:45,131
You'll need a passport, a driver's
license and a social security number.

383
00:26:45,198 --> 00:26:48,885
If you have to rent a car, find a
place that will take a cash deposit.

384
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:51,054
They'll still run
a credit check,

385
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:53,222
so use a real person's
name on the ID.

386
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,108
Third, destination.

387
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:58,195
<i>You want somewhere that doesn't
attract American tourists.</i>

388
00:26:58,262 --> 00:27:01,231
Think Yemen,
and you get the idea.

389
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:04,200
And money, you'll
need a truckload of it.

390
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:07,722
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

391
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,490
How much?

392
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:12,009
<i>Enough to last at</i>
<i>least five, six years.</i>

393
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:15,212
You run out of money,
you run out of friends.

394
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:23,488
But before you do anything, you have
to ask yourself if you can do it.

395
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:26,291
Can you forget about ever
seeing your parents again?

396
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:30,379
Can you kill a guard?
Leave your kid at a gas station?

397
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:32,497
Push some nice
old lady to the ground

398
00:27:32,565 --> 00:27:34,550
just because she gets
between you and the door?

399
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:38,387
Because to do this thing,
that's who you have to become.

400
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,325
And if you can't,
don't start,

401
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,211
'cause you'll just
get someone killed.

402
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,048
How did you get caught?

403
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,019
I gave myself up.

404
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,891
I couldn't take
wondering when someone

405
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:00,377
was gonna come through
the bedroom door.

406
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,483
So, what do you
have in your pocket?

407
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,036

Hey, not here.

509
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,841
I don't want you
coming back here again.

510
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:09,101
Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
Under the bridge, 2:00.

511
00:39:09,169 --> 00:39:11,521
If I'm not there
on time, leave.

a few moments.

Yes.

519
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:24,064
Yeah, I found myself falling
asleep grading papers.

520

When?

521
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:28,436
I guess about a year ago.

without my wife.

525
00:40:43,737 --> 00:40:45,871

I close my eyes,
I see Luke in his bedroom,

529
00:41:01,388 --> 00:41:04,057
and you on the sofa
by the window.

530
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:10,397

854
01:21:57,055 --> 01:21:58,106
Okay.

855
01:22:32,443 --> 01:22:33,910
Hey, bud.

856
01:22:34,912 --> 01:22:36,329
So...

857
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:38,682
You all right?

858
01:22:39,584 --> 01:22:40,767
Yeah.

859
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,439
They're calling all
the party animals.

860
01:22:45,506 --> 01:22:48,042

861
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:50,361

862
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:52,379
Okay? Here we go.

863
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:14,487
Yeah, taillight matches
any 2004 to 2009 Prius.

864
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:17,390
What kind of criminal
drives a Prius?

865
01:23:17,457 --> 01:23:19,158
A socially responsible one.

866
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:22,979
There's over 1,000 registered in
the city, 7,000 in the state.

867
01:23:23,046 --> 01:23:24,630

registered to felons?

868
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:26,298
<font color="#808080">HARRIS:</font>
Six in the state.

869
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:28,400
Four to embezzlers,
white-collar criminals,

870
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:30,570
one to a rapist,
one to a murderer.

871
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:32,039
Start with the murderer.

872
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:33,907
She's in prison for life.

873
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:34,975
Rapist is out.

874
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:40,230
Find him.

875
01:23:41,799 --> 01:23:43,066

It's good to
see you, too.

879
01:23:57,049 --> 01:23:58,315
Hi, Luke.

880
01:23:58,383 --> 01:24:00,417
It's a pony.

881
01:24:00,485 --> 01:24:02,587
Those aren't
easy to wrap.

882
01:24:05,242 --> 01:24:07,476
You know the party is
not until 11:00, right?

883
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,211
Really?

884
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:11,380
What is it? Around 9:00?
I'm sorry.

885
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:13,649
I should've read it
more carefully.

886
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:17,119
It's no problem.
Why don't you go give this to Carrie?

887
01:24:20,858 --> 01:24:22,158
Well, I guess
you can help.

888
01:24:22,226 --> 01:24:24,293
Actually, I've gotta go
and run some errands.

889
01:24:25,362 --> 01:24:26,362
Sorry.

890
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:31,034
We'll see you
later then.

891
01:24:32,437 --> 01:24:34,037

892
01:24:35,757 --> 01:24:36,924

893
01:24:39,327 --> 01:24:42,329
He has my parents'
phone number.

894
01:24:42,397 --> 01:24:45,282
In his jacket.
Top pocket of his jacket.

895
01:24:47,903 --> 01:24:49,887
If I'm running late.

896
01:24:50,438 --> 01:24:51,906
No problem.

897
01:25:02,335 --> 01:25:04,119
The rapist is
in a wheelchair.

898
01:25:04,187 --> 01:25:05,721
Not sure if that was
karma or just bad luck.

899
01:25:05,788 --> 01:25:08,073
The murderer.
Where is she incarcerated?

900
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,859
County, right
here in town.

901
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:13,079
Does she have a husband or
a kid old enough to drive?

902
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:29,130
Yes? What?

903
01:25:29,197 --> 01:25:31,298

Take her to University Hospital.
I'll meet them there.

911
01:25:59,096 --> 01:26:01,931
Right. Thanks.

913
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,618
You got a home address?

914
01:27:11,955 --> 01:27:14,857
No car in the garage.
You want to get a warrant?

915
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:16,092
Yeah.

916
01:27:46,209 --> 01:27:47,659
Get the warrant.

917
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:33,608

- Right now.

919

Have them call

their damn kid?

1025
01:38:37,481 --> 01:38:39,098
Six.

1026
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:41,067
Find out where he is.

1027
01:38:46,075 --> 01:38:47,241
Why didn't you tell me?

1028
01:38:47,308 --> 01:38:48,308
You would've stopped me.

1029
01:38:49,594 --> 01:38:51,528
Your insulin is in here.

1030
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:54,131
There's a case in here.
It's got a brush, moisturizer, makeup.

1031
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:57,051
Everything you had was old.
I hope I got it right.

1032
01:39:07,013 --> 01:39:09,331
You remember where
you last saw him?

1033
01:39:09,398 --> 01:39:12,401
You want to take a guess
who just escaped from jail?

1034
01:39:12,468 --> 01:39:13,535
Hold on a second.

1035
01:39:19,343 --> 01:39:20,376
Hello.

1036
01:39:20,444 --> 01:39:21,977
Hi. I'm here
to pick up my son.

1037
01:39:22,045 --> 01:39:23,479
They aren't back yet.

1038
01:39:24,865 --> 01:39:26,499
Back from where?

1039
01:39:26,567 --> 01:39:28,017
From the zoo.

1040
01:39:31,188 --> 01:39:32,555
It's a zoo party.

1041
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:37,027
They should be back in about
an hour if you'd like to wait.

1042
01:39:37,095 --> 01:39:38,712
No. Thank you.

1043
01:39:43,135 --> 01:39:45,219
What's wrong?
What is it?

1044
01:39:46,388 --> 01:39:47,621
Where is he?
Where's Luke?

1045
01:39:47,689 --> 01:39:49,289
He's at the party.

1046
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:51,024
What party?
You said the party was here.

1047
01:39:51,092 --> 01:39:53,695
I was wrong.
She's taken them to the zoo.

- What?
- They'll look after him,

and I'll figure out a way

1068
01:42:35,533 --> 01:42:36,984
I tried! There's
no more time!

be a roadblock ahead of us.

It might be there now! If we don't
get out now, we don't get out!

1071
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:45,910
I'll find a way of getting him to
us, all right? I'll find a way.

1072

No, really, it's fine. I just can't thank
you enough for taking care of him.
