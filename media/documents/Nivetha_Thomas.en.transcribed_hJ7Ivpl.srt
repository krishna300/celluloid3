1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,719
good evening everybody my name is Nevada

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:18,330
Thomas it is really nice to see you all

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,689
for a girl with many dreams aspirations

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,110
and ambitions the one thing that I was

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,669
fighting against was the lack of time

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:31,590
but I think it's safe to say we all wish

7
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:33,480
we had more of that time as our lives

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,750
and everything around us seems to be

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,148
moving seems to be like somebody played

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,490
a tape recorder press the fast-forward

11
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,220
button and left it that way it's all

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:48,630
moving at such a rapid pace right so it

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,120
is only fair to us to pause breathe and

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,570
take a moment to think about the past

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,730
the good we faced the bad we experienced

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,410
but mind you when you move forward and

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,529
like the only baggage that you would

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,179
want to carry forward should be the good

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,409
because it would be an unpleasant case

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,930
otherwise as I sat down to think about

21
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,909
how to brainstorm and compile everything

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,380
that I wanted to talk about today there

23
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,270
was one moment it was more of the

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,789
revelation when I realized if one 23

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,030
year old had so many things to talk

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:26,939
about so much to say imagine the kind of

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,319
life experiences and stories you would

28
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,020
get to hear from people around the world

29
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:35,420
it was really exciting to think about it

30
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,340
let me take you through mine now

31
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,590
so I was born and raised in the

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,529
beautiful China City but my roots go

33
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,649
back to a small village in it called a

34
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:48,990
duel in irritating Kerala though I was

35
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,779
raised schooled everything in thumb in

36
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,329
Urdu my connect with my homeland Kerala

37
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:57,689
is very strong in fact it's as strong as

38
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,579
my love for Kappa fish curry for Emporia

39
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,869
and Shia is there are Mele alleys here

40
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,499
you will know exactly what I'm talking

41
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,499
about it's deep trust more but I think I

42
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:10,410
am privileged to say I believe that I'm

43
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:11,549
equally a Telugu am I now as much as I

44
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,520
am a Malayalee

45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,620
and a Tamilian and this because this

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,620
cultural integration is what makes me

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,650
call anywhere home and I believe this

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,489
cultural integration is is

49
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,409
necessary for us to grow better rolling

50
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,319
back a couple of years now we're getting

51
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,909
into the the topic I'm going to share

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,060
with you a couple of my life experiences

53
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,530
what I went through and whatever I am

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,689
today is because of all these

55
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,549
experiences I had so I would like to

56
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,030
share it with all of you so rolling back

57
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:46,939
a couple of yours the word school the

58
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,599
word school resonated with an album to

59
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,250
me like a photo album of Polaroids

60
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,459
flashing in front of my eyes I have very

61
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,609
vivid memories of what school meant to

62
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:02,389
me I faced the camera first when I was

63
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:04,389
eight years old and since then believe

64
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:07,879
it or not I have been to school

65
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:10,189
sometimes visited school by visit I mean

66
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,000
literally just visited school three or

67
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:15,049
four times three or four days a month

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,569
honestly that's how much I've been there

69
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:20,900
there are I I think definitely my

70
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:22,578
teachers must have seen chief guests

71
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,359
repeat themselves to events more than

72
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:29,199
I've actually been in school but going

73
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:31,150
to work acting you know on longer

74
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,290
schedules and then coming back to

75
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,230
sitting in class being attentive

76
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,480
completing class works being on par with

77
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,030
where the rest of the class was was very

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,119
taxing sometimes I would also want to

79
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:48,260
give up removing all the makeup before I

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:52,190
fly to bed not the fair I could think

81
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,828
about it or realize you know the the

82
00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:00,909
struggle with all this this had already

83
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:05,000
become my life so as a kid I remember I

84
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:06,940
wanted to take a moment to decide on few

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,190
things before I proceeded forward I

86
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,978
wanted to draw a line between work and

87
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,780
study that's what I wanted to do it

88
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,120
sounds like a very very simple idea but

89
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,339
trust me when I say this it required a

90
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,909
battalion a battalion of people to

91
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:26,239
execute I needed my teachers my

92
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:29,030
principal my friends from workplace my

93
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,520
friends from school my producers my

94
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,820
directors all my technicians and my

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,500
family more than anything

96
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,530
and today when I look back and think

97
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,390
about it I have been more than blessed I

98
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,450
feel like I've been blessed more than

99
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,820
required to have had them all in fact my

100
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,099
school was so supportive my principal

101
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,490
brother George was so supportive of me

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,950
going to act that the three or four days

103
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,420
that I would go to go to school he would

104
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,830
look at me and be like oh no Bates are

105
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:01,450
you're here when are you going back to

106
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:05,080
work I was like let me and my timing was

107
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:08,409
so off the four or five days are like

108
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,219
that I got to be in school was when I

109
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,170
had my math test

110
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,230
don't even ask me about it I've also

111
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:21,460
played stunts where I I have fever and I

112
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:27,510
I want my mom to take me back home just

113
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:31,299
once but yeah I have done that sadly

114
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:34,590
school was school was abundant school

115
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,980
was what set my foundation the base of

116
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,679
the base for me was is it's just it's so

117
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,170
strong and I can so happily say that my

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,370
character and my personality anything to

119
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,040
deal with the development of my

120
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:52,390
personality I owe it to my school and I

121
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,460
can't thank or talk enough about the

122
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,250
importance of holistic education that I

123
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:02,020
received from school this one memory is

124
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:06,070
so vivid in my mind where the fact that

125
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:08,950
I the announcement of me receiving my

126
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,060
first ever award for my first film in

127
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,159
Malayalam which is called where the

128
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,680
other barrier I had received a kerala

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,480
state award for it and the work the

130
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,170
person I got to know that from was

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,030
brother George my principal I was in the

132
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,980
school ground practicing long jump for

133
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,070
something for the sports tape all muddy

134
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,310
and dirty and there's the student who

135
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,599
come says who spells calling you

136
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,330
what do you instantly think I'm like

137
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,580
what did I do now I behave that was okay

138
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,700
did I do something wrong

139
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,039
so from point A to point B that's what

140
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,570
I'm I'm thinking about so I go to his

141
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,510
office and then he turns on the

142
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:49,260
television tunes into a channel

143
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:53,480
and he simply said who won so I saw my

144
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,610
name scrolling down with the picture em

145
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,870
honestly that moment it hit me so hard

146
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:03,480
that rather than feeling accomplished or

147
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:08,840
satisfied everything around me became

148
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:11,850
muted it got really quiet and I thought

149
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,080
that appreciation came just at the right

150
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:18,750
moment in my life when I almost took it

151
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,340
synonymous to wanting to show my

152
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,190
gratitude towards all the people who

153
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,590
helped me get to that point my principal

154
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,730
my family everybody came to my mind at

155
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,770
that point it was just so special and

156
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:34,350
that episode ended with you know like in

157
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,690
my mind it was like all my teachers from

158
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:41,520
graduating me and seeing them celebrate

159
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:43,590
and seeing them feel so joyous about me

160
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,500
achieving something was validation to me

161
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:50,400
that all that hours and days of hard

162
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:55,580
work doing what I loved doing was

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:59,789
absolutely worth it so from then on I

164
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:03,419
was happily studying away till there was

165
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:06,060
one moment where I I think I can speak

166
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,310
confidently for all of you there's that

167
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,300
one moment in your school life when we

168
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,070
feel something completely brand new this

169
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,530
is exactly after I finished my twelfth

170
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,990
grade which for some reason at this

171
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,169
point in time it feels like a danger

172
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,180
zone that's how it that's how it's made

173
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:29,430
to be felt like a danger zone when I

174
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:32,150
cross that that that stayed I was posted

175
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:37,049
with a very very very difficult question

176
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:41,520
what next honestly this is how it was in

177
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:44,670
my mind the room got extremely dark

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,160
there's a focus light on you all your

179
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:51,709
relatives start becoming active again

180
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,900
even distant once your parents are alert

181
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,730
your siblings if you have younger ones a

182
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,310
sister or a brother he or she is

183
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,190
suddenly looking up up at you thinking

184
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,420
what are you going to do who are you

185
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:08,130
going to be what do you become

186
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,579
what do you want to become who do you

187
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,140
want to be in life look though this is

188
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,940
an exercise just go home and say this

189
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,400
question three times then you'll want to

190
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,920
sit down because I've never been able to

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,569
answer this question who do you want to

192
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,050
become what do you want to become in

193
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,510
life

194
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,660
it's an incredibly heavy question which

195
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:30,319
I feel requires a lot of thinking and a

196
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:35,000
lot more living to actually figure out

197
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,890
so at that point I had to choose between

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,910
walking a trodden path or an untrodden

199
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,439
path either you work in films or you

200
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,620
study something you specialize in some

201
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:52,020
field and become something but I chose

202
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:54,330
to walk in between yeah I did back then

203
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:58,140
I don't know I was just I I remember

204
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:01,500
telling my parents Amma daddy I want to

205
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,300
I want to work as I'm studying and I

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,089
remember them looking at each other and

207
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,829
they were like well if you can manage

208
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,930
then we don't have a problem with it

209
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,060
because honestly this decision was taken

210
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,859
by me honestly because I couldn't

211
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,689
imagine myself doing just one of it

212
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,280
because most of my life I've been

213
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,290
working and studying together so I just

214
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,089
couldn't think about doing choosing one

215
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,569
from that point on everything moved so

216
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,600
fast

217
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,130
it moved literally like this I moved on

218
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,890
from wanting to study aerospace

219
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,260
engineering to joining University to

220
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,760
study five years of architecture don't

221
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,760
ask me how that happened that happened

222
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:48,480
so when this fairy tale of school life

223
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,209
was just ending the actual picture came

224
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,220
into my life when I started college

225
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:55,860
College came in like a royal entry it

226
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,460
had a royal entry call it sort of feels

227
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,589
like us going to watch a Rajinikanth

228
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:06,150
film first day first show you have this

229
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:07,920
unexplainable hi you don't know what

230
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,449
you're feeling you suddenly feel like an

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,370
adult you you know you're given up

232
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,990
you're given a car you can drive

233
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,510
yourself to college

234
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,399
you know school though it's only cycling

235
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,410
and auto man

236
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,910
maybe my van driver who drove me for 14

237
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,740
years and suddenly you have a car

238
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,620
you have a place to park your car and

239
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,540
then you no longer wearing uniforms it's

240
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,410
so exciting you know you you feel like

241
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,899
you're an adult and you have

242
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:37,380
responsibilities and honestly no money

243
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:40,560
can ever buy the experiences that I had

244
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,830
or the lessons I learned during college

245
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:49,319
the five years of me studying an

246
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:50,730
institution and moving around with the

247
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,860
people there

248
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,660
it taught me more about myself than

249
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,660
anything or anybody could have ever

250
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,459
taught me

251
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,250
College was fun but architecture did not

252
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:07,199
serve it easy for me or for any of my

253
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:11,610
classmates for that matter I was visibly

254
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,399
struggling at this point I was I I had a

255
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,620
lot of struggles with having to manage

256
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,910
minimum attendance required to appear

257
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,700
for exams struggling with trying to

258
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,140
trying really hard to perform well

259
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,500
struggling with completely completing

260
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,000
designs on time struggling to be on par

261
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,230
with where the rest of the class was

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,709
this was extremely taxing it was but

263
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,029
while also listening to strip readings

264
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,609
and there were a lot of narrations

265
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,189
happening which I would okay at one

266
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,290
point so that I can work on those films

267
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,279
when I had my semester vacation so this

268
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:52,770
is how my pattern in college life was

269
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:57,390
all this was happening but the real

270
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:00,990
struggle was inside me I was constantly

271
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:04,920
at war with my mind I was struggling

272
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:07,320
with exaggerated thoughts I was fighting

273
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,649
against stress more than the physical

274
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:16,010
exhaustion I was fighting against stress

275
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:19,850
strain fear doubt overthinking

276
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:22,250
procrastination and also extreme

277
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,740
self-criticism

278
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,060
all these were emotions I was not

279
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,310
prepared to fail

280
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,310
I was not prepared to handle nobody

281
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,589
taught me in school or anywhere to to

282
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,869
learn how to handle these things and all

283
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:40,190
I would do is sometimes just break down

284
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:44,460
and cry would that make me feel better

285
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:47,700
sometimes but not really I would not

286
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:54,240
know what to do when I was in a point

287
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:56,490
that way it was extremely difficult now

288
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,470
when I think about that face between

289
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:04,740
2013 and 2018 happily thinking about it

290
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,380
I also think how did I even get through

291
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,660
how did I get through that at that point

292
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,700
how did I go through from semester to

293
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,709
semester how did I even do that I think

294
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:19,020
about it and there were a couple of

295
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:22,050
things that came to my mind was it the

296
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,970
way I was so warmly welcomed into a

297
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,550
whole new industry the Telugu industry

298
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,280
which happened during my second year of

299
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,410
college or was it the kind of

300
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,660
appreciation that I and my team received

301
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,689
for films like gentlemen and then the

302
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,969
quarry and everything that followed

303
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:43,230
wasn't the radical thinking of my mom

304
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:46,650
and the constant support she gave me was

305
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:50,280
it the difficulty with which my father

306
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:53,310
moved so far away from family to work

307
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,610
for the family earn money for the family

308
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,650
keep us in good shape while he missed us

309
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,010
so much and still worked with so much of

310
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,870
conviction was it seeing my brother live

311
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:09,540
his life like there's no tomorrow so

312
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:11,480
happy was it seeing my friends though

313
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,130
they were having struggles of their own

314
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,930
working extremely hard toiling

315
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,360
rigorously to make sure that they

316
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:24,300
accomplished their dreams while helping

317
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:27,630
me out - or was it the hand of God that

318
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,579
was constantly there beside me guiding

319
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,650
me through every step of the way and

320
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,910
always whispering in my ears that you're

321
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:39,180
not alone yes I believe it was all of

322
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,300
this but most importantly it was the

323
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,359
small decision that

324
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,479
I made to have little faith in myself

325
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,020
that I could do it no matter what I

326
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
could do it it seemed like a very very

327
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,829
simple idea

328
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:59,560
but it actually worked

329
00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:02,260
I just thought this is my life I wanted

330
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,510
this I should be prepared from all of

331
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,210
this because I chose this the decision

332
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,970
was mine so no matter how difficult it

333
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,680
gets nobody is going to help you nobody

334
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,980
is going to be able to help you but

335
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,670
yourself so when I pass out of college

336
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:21,160
honestly I came out I believe I came out

337
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:24,189
much stronger I came out to be a

338
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,650
stronger person mentally and physically

339
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,940
I started appreciating myself more I

340
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:34,949
accepted the bodily changes I had

341
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,660
through time I understood the value and

342
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:41,160
importance of constructive criticism and

343
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,250
I started seeing beauty and flaws

344
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,250
because trust me I realized more than

345
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:52,300
ever that we are perfect just the way we

346
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:54,490
are we don't realize it we are perfect

347
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,969
just the way we are and boys and girls

348
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,550
please don't bend your knee to satisfy

349
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:06,670
societal standards live your life

350
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:10,240
because that's yours and no matter how

351
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:13,630
much you wish you got help no matter how

352
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,880
much you wish that this moment just fast

353
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,280
I closed my eyes in this moment just

354
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,709
pass it will never happen because those

355
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,420
things only happen in movies you know

356
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,070
they really don't happen into your life

357
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,620
so as long as you start believing in

358
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:31,210
believing in yourself these things will

359
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:33,669
not magically happen and through all

360
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,560
this I realize the importance of people

361
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,590
and the importance of interaction I

362
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,919
needed people you know people are what

363
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:46,360
people are who made me get through all

364
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,190
this time they helped me a lot every

365
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,740
doctor needs a patient every police

366
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,860
needs a case every climber needs a

367
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,560
mountain every speaker needs an audience

368
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,520
likewise

369
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,020
every actor needs an audience like every

370
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,680
speaker needs a listener every actor

371
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:06,230
needs an audience and me being an actor

372
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,640
I feel extremely privileged to be able

373
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:13,400
to be so many different kinds of people

374
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,560
because that is my dream we human beings

375
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,330
are gregarious in nature no man is an

376
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,240
island we cannot live in an in an

377
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,710
alienated society so I believe the

378
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,090
choices I make

379
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,860
I wanted the choices that I make to have

380
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,530
a rippling effect in the society but not

381
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:34,939
a crippling effect I wanted to make sure

382
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:37,970
that I am different people that was my

383
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,520
dream that is my dream I want to be so

384
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,550
many different characters I want to have

385
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,290
I want to portray the shades that we all

386
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,169
experience and we wish we experience

387
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:53,090
from good to the bad to fictional

388
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:55,100
everything and I all this while

389
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,709
everything that I was saying my life

390
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,540
story is not great my life story is not

391
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,120
extraordinary and I did not do great

392
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,430
things but the only thing that I did and

393
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,959
that I'm happy about is that I just

394
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:12,680
would not quit I would not want to stop

395
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,160
trying so I want to portray people that

396
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:20,060
way you know and the medium this is my

397
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,880
dream so the medium I choose to voice

398
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:27,340
out my expression is cinema and I will

399
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,340
always continue doing that thank you

400
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,109
[Applause]
